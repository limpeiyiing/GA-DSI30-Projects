Chiropractic,"I run a rehab-based cash practice, have been open for 18 months and have been doing very well so far.

We do a lot of rehab, ART, class 4 laser, etc in the practice and I‚Äôm getting ready to expand and hire on staff (CA, strength coach, receptionist) and with the expansion and the increased provider availability I‚Äôm thinking about adding on insurance contracts to increase our patient population.

There are two primary non-ASH insurance companies in town, both with moderate reimbursement rates for chiro but I would estimate about 70% of the non-Medicare population use these two.

Chiropractic,"Hi! Heading into a heavy recruitment/growth phase, I was hoping to hear some perspectives on the optimal benefits package; we want to offer the best option we can afford. I have very little experience as a healthcare consumer, but based on doing admin for our practice over the past two years it makes the most sense to me to do a HDHP with good coverage both in- and out-of-network and a company funded HSA covering the full deductible. But I know people have varying priorities when it comes to their healthcare.

What do people look for in a benefits package? What about dependents? Would an HRA be a better choice? For clinicians, would you like having the option to take a higher base salary/split in lieu of group health insurance and shop for your own plan on the marketplace? Is it more attractive to pay a lower portion of the premium than having the deductible covered? I know some options have more tax advantages on the employer side, but our top priority is a clinic culture of support and safety. 

If possible I would love to hear from practice owners, associates/new grads (DC or DPT), LMTs, CAs, other admin/support staff, and job seekers of any kind really.

Chiropractic,"A warning for anybody wanting to go to a chiropractor. My life was ruined by one. I went for a routine adjustment after many years. However it was a cervical adjustment gone wrong. 

The chiropractor sat me in a chair and grabbed my skull by both sides before twisting the head in both directions. 

There was a loud crack from the left to right adjustment. I immediately knew something was wrong. Within 5 minutes of leaving the clinic I had muffled ear. Bh that night a sore neck on the left and tinnitus. Over the course of the next few days I gradually got worse and worse, insomnia, fatigue, headaches, pain behind my left eye and other symptoms. Fully listed below:

Ear and head pressure
Jaw stiffness
Tinnitus
Stiff neck mostly left hand side
Neck grinding a bit
Little bit of a headache
Even my right arm feels a bit off
Trouble sleeping
Sweating a lot at night
Nausea
Tiredness
Tightness in my throat like a lump
A little bit of blurred vision in left eye
Balance was off a little bit

Having contacted the chiropractor he told me my atlas ‚Äúmust be out‚Äù. He said he could fix it. I went back a week later for an adjustment which he performed with an adjusting type spring device.

Having left the clinic I then felt a great sense of euphoria surge through my head. Unlike anything I had ever felt before.

I have never been the same since. Pains up the base of my skull, tinnitus, libido issues, loss of balance and coordination, memory, focus and concentration all affected.

Chiropractic,"Hey all, so ChiroOne came to my work and I signed up for a first appointment before seeing all the issues with them online. I still went, got my x-ray, all that.. overall the doctor I saw was pretty nice and helpful but I don't plan to spend my entire deductible on a few weeks of visits.

A bit of info on me, I am 30 years old, female, 5'4"" 140ish pounds, fairly active at my gym and overall healthy. I do have a bad back however, my lower back sometimes can be really stiff especially in mornings, and my upper back near my neck is basically always kind of sore/irritated. I used to go to a chiropractor for a while but he moved and haven't been to one in over a year. I did feel like his adjustments helped, I'd go once a month.

Anyway, the ChiroOne doctor I saw said I have a foreword head posture, and it does make sense. He only x-rayed my neck since that is a constant pain/stiffness unlike my lower back which is more painful but much less often. I am wondering if you all have opinions on this.. is this a real thing, is this what is causing my upper back and neck to hurt most likely, etc, and what can I do? I am willing to go back to a chiropractor but not one that costs that much, however it seems like something I might be able to ""correct"" on my own or at the very least try some things and if it feels better, I know that's the problem. I tried to look up more about it online but I feel like the information isn't super clear.

Chiropractic,"A colleague of mine recently met the owner of ChiroOne. I had never heard of this place before but apparently they have something like 120 offices and according to the owner, the company is making $24 million/year in profit. My friend is a data dork and got to see some behind the scenes action with the data the company collects in real time, some real impressive computerized ""dashboards."" He felt like the owner was super up front with everything and just wants to run good practices for doctors who want to see patients and not necessarily run a business. Pay sounded pretty good, hiring, firing, training, etc all seemed to go through the main office in Chicago, etc etc. My friend was really impressed and I got some ""too good to be true"" vibes. 

I guess they promote a CBP-like model and after some digging around I saw they do some recruiting seminars in Chicago for students (likely looking for potential hires, which is smart) with Deed Harrison presenting, but it didn't look like the usual corny BS you see from practice management groups. 

I was surprised mainly because this colleague is somewhat jaded and cynical and he was over the moon meeting the owner of ChiroOne and touring the place. He hasn't stopped talking about it for weeks.

I'm a personal trainer of 20 years, and perform myofascial release on all of my clients at the end of our sessions.  Recently I had an experience while performing myofascial release on a client that was a bit disturbing to say the least.  

Yesterday I had a 33 year old fit client on his back and I was performing mfr on his chest.  I was using a pvc pipe with a cap on the end to release his upper chest.  I was putting pretty good pressure on him, but no more than any of my other male clients with of his size.  I was pressing in when his chest depressed in what I would describe as a violent release.  I immediately stopped pressing and asked if he was in pain.  He wasn't.  We were bothe more startled than anything.  I palpated and it was sore, but nothing crazy.  I asked him how it felt to flex to make sure the muscle fibers weren't damaged and he was fine, he said he felt very little pain.  I asked him to do a push up and again no pain.  We then went out and did some light cable Flys, again no pain.  So I was thinking it was either a crazy release, or perhaps I had just slipped off of a tight fiber bundle.  

Today he came in for a session and it was a push day.  I went very conservatively with him and he said there was a little bit of pain, but nothing to be worried about.  I have asked him to keep me up to date on any new pains or changes in his condition, and he jest messaged me that it was hurting a little bit when he breathed in deeply.  This got me thinking that it could be a rib injury, which I should have been suspecting all along.  

I guess my question is that for those of you with experience with a dislocated or subluxed rib, does this sound like that's what it is?  Have any of you ever had anything like this happen while you were pressing on someone's chest?  If he's mostly pain free, how concerned should I be, etc...

Chiropractic,"I currently work as a receptionist/general office ast. I'm still new at the office, and to chiropractic care as a whole. However, I've worked for doctors before. This is the first time I've had a doctor tell me to write SOAP and Initial notes by myself which he then briefly reviews and signs. Let me make this clear - I HAVE NO CERTIFICATION OR MEDICAL EDUCATION OF ANY KIND. So it seems really wrong for me to be ""telling the story for insurance"" in patient chart notes, especially for patients I never even met before. I had to teach myself the different muscles and joints in about 3 days to be able to ""pick a few and go with it"" for the notes. If I don't know what segments were adjusted, he said to always put the same few ones (L4, L5, T6, whatever) because he does the same treatment for everyone. Also, starting probably today I'll have to start writing patient notes in between patients, who I am responsible for bringing to the traction table and the exam rooms every 7-10 mins.

I rarely complain but it seems that the more I keep quiet, the more I get taken advantage of. I go back and forth between her 2 offices and see 50-60 patients a day and work 5 days a week. I am really trying to stay until my year contract is done in July but it keeps getting worse. On top of seeing patients for 11-12 hours a day, I‚Äôm expected to do CA work (insurance, know insurance prices, write my X-ray reports and hers, etc). And when a patient requests to see her, the CA‚Äôs have to say that she doesn‚Äôt have any availability (but has plenty) and but if they see me, it can be as soon as tomorrow or day after, which they either say they won‚Äôt make the appointment or they they come to see me for the first visit (for exam and history)and request to see her. She also micromanaged a lot of what I do and makes me look bad. My question is, I always feel bad when I stand up for myself. I am not sure how to handle this. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her before but she always tends to one up me on everything. Should I put my 30 days in now? Or should I just wait until June to put my notice? How do I handle this until then without mentally being drained and burnt out.",Quitting associate chiropractic job
Chiropractic,I was stretching this morning while in bed as I was waking up and felt a huge pop in my neck followed by severe pain. Now if I move my head to the left the pain tenses up and tightens. I can't really move my neck without feeling super intense pain. Are there ways to take care of this at home by myself? I have to move in 2 days.,Can't move my neck without intense pain
