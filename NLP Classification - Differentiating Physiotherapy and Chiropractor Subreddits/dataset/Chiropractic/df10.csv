Chiropractic,"Long story short, I have a very misaligned neck at my upper cervical. It's basically became an ""S"" shape almost so it looks like scoliosis. My surgeries are neck fusion at C5-C7 which really helped with severe spinal stenosis. The next was an artificial disc at C3-C4 which I believe caused the neck structure change.

I considered NUCCA to try and correct what is wrong, and had a free consultation to explain NUCCA to me, if it could be helped, what the out of pocket costs are, etc. Seemed like a lot of info but never really went into detail about the images I sent them to tell me what they saw was wrong.

So here's my question. Should a NUCCA doctor be working with me now that I'm 2 year post op and can I be corrected without affecting the surgeries? Or is this a ""avoid at all costs"" situation for myself and the doctor.

It's the typical chiropractor responses I got ""I can help you. We work with patients post-op. We don't work with insurance. Here's the cost. See me 1-2 times a week for 2 months""","NUCCA after 2 neck surgeries, yay or no?"

Chiropractic,"Hello everyone,

I went to see a chiropractor the first time in my life to help with my reoccurring neck and shoulder pain. She seems very skilled and got some good reviewes and after an examination I had my first adjustment yesterday. Lower back and neck adjustment. She tried the upper back but she did not get it out and said we will focus on that another time as it‚Äôs too inflamed at the moment. 
Right after I felt great a little light headed but overall a lot more movable than I am used to. 
Until I woke up this morning and at my upper back between C4 and C7 I have a very sharp pain if I move my head. I went over today again and she said I should get an x-ray to see what‚Äôs happening. 
I have read a lot of horror stories and I am concerned of a stroke now. I still feel a little light headed but this could be coming from the pain as well. Could it be that she caused a herniated disk now? Should I change chiropractors? Should I stop or give her another chance after the x-ray?

Chiropractic,"Hello!

I am considering finding an alternative method for dealing with my chronic back pain - but I'm not sure if its the right move. Any advice would be helpful. 

**Backstory:**

I have had a several injuries over the years to my spine, and also to my knees which has continued to build up over the years. Over the pandemic I started seeing a chiropractor to help adjust my spine.  They planned to reverse the curve in my neck, as well as help fix some kyphosis I had as well. However, I have been going for almost a year / perhaps over a year and I am still dealing with chronic pain and sometimes, even limited mobility. I can walk and hike for short periods, which I was unable to do before. But I am still feeling frustrated and I feel like perhaps I need to find another way to start building my strength. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Chiro I see, I feel is very good. They have me do exercises at the facility, I get my adjustment, and I also have daily exercises they have prescribed. I have a positive change in my neck curve and have seen improvement. But I feel that this treatment option is quite expensive - as I have already spent quite a lot over the last year here. luckily I have had help from insurance, but I do not believe my current plan covers Chiro care.  Anyways - that being said, does anyone with a similar diagnosis have any input? Is the chronic pain supposed to exist forever? Because I don't feel like it should. I mean surely there is way to fix everything. I also have had issues with my sleep schedule, mood, and digestive issues which I believe is also tied to my spine health as well.  Some of these things have improved - and some of them have either remained the same or progressed further. 

I feel like my doctors have been very helpful, but at the same time I feel my gut is telling me its time to move on. Anyone have recommendations on how you finally strengthen your spine?",Dealing with chronic pain

Chiropractic," 

Chiropractic is a healthcare profession that focuses on musculoskeletal and neurological system diseases and the consequences of these abnormalities on overall health. Chiropractors are trained to evaluate and restore joint function. Back pain, neck discomfort, arm and leg pain, and headaches are among the most common neuromusculoskeletal symptoms treated with chiropractic care.

Doctors of Chiropractic (sometimes known as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians) are healthcare providers who use a drug-free, hands-on approach which involves patient assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Chiropractors are educated and trained to diagnose patients and offer therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises along with nutritional, dietary and lifestyle advice. 

## 7 Considerations When Finding Your Chiropractor

1. **Recommendations**  
When looking for a chiropractor, the first thing to consider is who comes highly recommended. You should check for references and reviews from at least two sources. To begin, request a referral list from your doctor. This is a smart place to start because your primary care physician is familiar with your medical needs. Based on this information, they will be able to provide an informed recommendation.
2. **Coverage**  
A practical consideration is insurance. Look for chiropractors who are covered by your insurance plan to prevent paying for your chiropractic appointments out of pocket. Treatment with a chiropractor usually entails numerous visits.
3. **Do some preliminary research**  
You can begin your background research once you have your list of suggested chiropractors (and have confirmed which insurance plan is suitable). First, check to see if they have a Doctor of Chiropractic degree, which indicates they have undergone extensive training. Second, double-check that their license is current in British Columbia. You may find out their license number by simply calling their office and asking for it. 
4. **Customer feedback**  
Check out some customer reviews to see how each chiropractor you‚Äôre considering is rated. Because everyone‚Äôs experiences are different, customer reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. However, when reviewing a chiropractor, these can be useful in recognizing red flags. It‚Äôs also a red flag if you can‚Äôt find any client reviews ‚Äì you should go over your research again to see just how much experience the chiropractor has.
5. **The ability to specialize**  
Any chiropractor worth their salt should have dealt with a variety of problems. However, they are likely to have a certain specialty, and it‚Äôs worth looking into this to see if it applies to your treatment. Specializations can focus on either a certain body component or the damage type, even based on gender. To find out if a chiropractor‚Äôs speciality can help you, call their office or go to their website.
6. **Convenience**  
When it comes to choosing a chiropractor, convenience is crucial. You don‚Äôt want to go great distances to see them if you‚Äôre going to see them more than a few times. Therefore, look for chiropractors near your place of business, your child‚Äôs school, or your residence.
7. **Communication**  
When it comes to choosing a chiropractor, communication style is crucial. Because chiropractors will touch and manipulate your body, you should find someone you can converse with openly. You should also look for a chiropractor who will pay close attention and understand your issues.",What is the Definition of Chiropractic?
Chiropractic,"So this pain started about 3-4 months ago with a tight pulling burning pain between my shoulder blades. It‚Äôs changed multiple times been gone at times Always to return. I‚Äôve been to chiro who‚Äôs taken X-rays and done exam and said they think it‚Äôs due to a straight neck ? Whiplash syndrome possibly from old accidents(I‚Äôve had a lot) I‚Äôve also been to g p who did X-rays and said it‚Äôs arthritis. He gave me prednisone wich did help at one point and also muscle relaxers and they help a little as well. 

Overall it‚Äôs very hard to describe this pain, and I can‚Äôt trace it to an injury it just showed up ! The best way I can describe it is an odd constant tight feeling on my thoracic spine and base of my neck. It‚Äôs accompanied with little shooting pains that come and go quickly in my traps and in between my shoulder blades. There is a almost constant muscle spasm feeling like a muscle knot in the very center of my back( it has gotten a little better but still there) it‚Äôs also accompanied by a very tight feeling right where that muscle spasm feeling is right on my spine‚Ä¶ almost feels like my joint is locking up. 
There is also a lot of popping and cracking going on and I at some points feel like I have to constantly crack my upper back(therapeutic exercises have helped with that some) there are good days there are days where it‚Äôs rough, but it doesn‚Äôt keep me from doing anything.

Although I‚Äôm not one to deter away nor rejoice in chiropractic miracles, I‚Äôm looking for an explanation of this video:

From my understanding, frozen shoulder is a severely degenerative shoulder joint, usually from trauma, or overuse. However, the docs explanation in this doesn‚Äôt sit right with me and seems lacking. 

Just looking for further insight for anyone willing to comment. 

Also, what do you do for frozen shoulder? Passive modalities, co-manage, rehab?",Can someone explain this to me? Frozen shoulder and upper cervical adjusting

Chiropractic,"Hello:).

So I was doing negatives and I think it caused my atlas to go out. So I went and he said my leg was a .25 of an inch short. So how can I do pull-ups again without it going out of place? The bar I have just goes straight across the door and is screwed in on both sides. It can support a linebacker if they wanted. So that‚Äôs all good there. 

Also, if the atlas keeps going out of place, how come a surgeon can‚Äôt screw it into place or glue it into place? Tell me like I am five lol because I didn‚Äôt know the atlas existed until going to this doc. I will be honest chiropractors aren‚Äôt usually my last choice but desperate times called for desperate measures (after going to a regular chiropractor who used a lot of force and that did not help. Plus that guy didn‚Äôt do x-rays before hand or after). And it does help temporarily but I have to keep going and insurance does not cover. I am all ears though. I even had my hospital network do x-rays to see their opinion. And that gives me some more reassurance (since he is a radiologist). Lastly, is Palmer College like the ‚ÄúMayo Clinic‚Äù of chiropractor schooling? That‚Äôs where this person went to.",Chiropractor tells me I will be able to do pull-ups again
Chiropractic,,Going to chiropractor for sciatica pain with a fractured humerus.
Chiropractic,"Hi,

I've been struggling with fatigue and headaches and dizziness. I went to a chiropractor for the first time with these issues and a lot of neck pain. My chiro looked at my xrays and found my atlas was misaligned and I had a subluxation in my middle back.

Lately, especially the last few days, my energy and mental clarity has increased dramatically, particularly after my last adjustment.

There are a lot of factors in my life changing right now though, from medication timing to sleep. I'm trying to figure out why I feel so much better so I can keep doing whatever it is that's helping. I didn't know how tired I was until I've felt it leave my bones this last day or two.

Anyway, I'm not asking if it's the cause of my energy. I just want to know if it's possible for a neck adjustment to provide such robust results. Thanks!",Can Upper Cervical Adjustment Increase Energy?
Chiropractic,"Saw a new patient yesterday afternoon with a 9 month history of LBP. Said ""A few months ago I was at the club and this guy kept looking at me funny. Every time I looked up he was looking at me. He came over and said he was watching me walk and could tell my back was really hurting. He was right, it was really bad. He said he could do something to me to make it feel better and I was like 'You want to do something to me at the club, get the %\^$# outtta my face' and then he said, 'no no, I'm a chiropractor.' He did something to my back this way and then that way and twisted my head both ways, and it felt pretty good. I bought him a drink, man! He did it to a whole bunch of other people there at the club, too. He said he couldn't take any money because he was a student and not to tell anyone because if his school found out he'd get kicked out."" 

Sigh. Can't you people just wait three years and be responsible enough to get your own malpractice insurance before you start doing this? Have never understood students willing to risk felony charges to give free adjustments to people when they're drunk/high and they spend half the day in school racking, stacking and cracking people. I'm sure this person went to all their adjusting club buddies to talk about how he changed this guy's life and turned the power on, but I have news for you, his back is still messed up and you didn't accomplish anything other than looking like a fool. I told the guy to keep going to that club because maybe he'll get some free surgery or dental work out of it, too.","Students, don't do this"

Chiropractic,"I went to a chiropractor last Tuesday for a treatment he advertised for peripheral neuropathy. I do have bulging disks in my L5/S1 but no pain in my spine or pain at all. I have these two massive trigger points in my lower back that inflame easily. He asked me to come in for a neuropathy consultation. Instead he adjusted my back and I told him not to touch my lower back because of the trigger points. He has been my MRI as well. He did it anyway, i jumped with pain and he pushed all along my spine. I was ok initially, albeit some pain, but within 10 mins i had sharp shooting pain down my thighs. Next day, Wednesday i had some lower back pain and started to feel stiff in my upper back. By Thursday, the lower back pain was really bothering me And my doctor gave me steroids. By Friday, i was in so much pain, i had to call off of work and was bed ridden Saturday. Sunday i had to go to the ER because of pain, they did an xray but not an MRI. Gave me Valium. But my

Chiropractic,"Seeing a new chiropractor and doing some physical therapy via an app. This is the diagnosis:

You have early stage arthritis in your neck, loss of cervical curve, moving into a reversed curve, decreased disc space between C4/C5 and C5/C6. 

Under alignment: ""¬†Generalized straightening of lordotic curvature with slight reversal at C3 through C6 centered at C4/C5""


You will also see that he notes ""¬†Disc height is maintained at the visualized levels""


The decrease in disc height I mentioned earlier is caused by the straightening of lordotic curvature/slight reversal in your curvature centered at C4/C5, but this would not constitute degenerative disc disease at this time.

I know that arthritis is irreversible, but do any of you have any advice for improving the symptoms and getting back to as normal as possible? Any help is appreciated.",Arthritis in neck

My question is would I still be able to get into chiro just under a 3.0 gpa, I understand chiro program isn‚Äôt easy and I am taking four years of a rigorous undergrad where the hours would be similar or just a bit less I feel to a Chiro program. Putting in the hours and work is not the issue for me, it‚Äôs just the difficulty of my classes puts me back a bit of getting into chiro.

Chiropractic,"Having a disagreement with a colleague and I'm not sure there is a ""right"" answer, but I'm curious how others interpret this. 

The way I CPT code spinal adjustments is I only consider billing areas that had PART AND had ""medical necessity"" which I interpret as a complaint that could be reasonably attributed to an anatomic region. For example, patient has low back pain and I end up finding PART for and adjusting right SIJ, L3, T4 and C3. Even though I adjusted 4 regions, I would consider the LBP complaint as covering medical necessity for JUST the SIJ and L3, so I would bill this as a 98940.

My colleague's interpretation of this is that the PART findings themselves give you medical necessity and presence or lack of symptoms have nothing to do with it, so he would code the above scenario as a 98941.","Curious how you interpret ""medical necessity"" relative to coding adjustments"
