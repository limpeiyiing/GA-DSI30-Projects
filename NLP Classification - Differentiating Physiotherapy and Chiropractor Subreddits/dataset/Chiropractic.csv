4,Chiropractic,"So this is an update of sorts from my last post.  

I've had some x-rays and it turns out I have facet joint degeneration in my cervical and upper thoracic spine. 

These were asymptomatic until I had a cervical adjustment at my chiropractors office. The next morning I had severe painful neck spasms (radiologist could see the alignment was off, said likely due to spasm).  

It's been more than a month, I've done masage, acupuncture, muscle relaxants, stretching, with minimal relief.

22,Chiropractic,"Over the past few years I've had on and off pain in my piriformis either on the left or right, where it happens seems random. I do lift heavy weight very frequently as powerlifting has been something I've been doing for many years. The pain would come on for about a week and then when it's gone it's like it never happened and wouldn't bother me for maybe another half a year or longer.

About 3 weeks ago it started up again and this is the longest it's ever lasted which is what concerns me. In the time since I haven't been squatting or deadlifting. At its worst about 2 weeks ago the pain was so bad that doing things like getting out of bed was extremely painful and I'd be practically limping for the first minute or so. Going for walks was also 7/10 in pain and discomfort, and you could probably tell I wasn't walking normally. The pain would seem to move from my SI joint to my piriformis at different points in the day. 

I started going to a physio recently and I felt like they were only treating the pain temporarily, so I looked for a Chiro who historically has always helped me recover from my moderate lifting related injuries. The Chiro did an assessment (which partially included a glute bridge which was 9/10 pain), took x rays and did an adjustment on my SI, which I should say brought about the most sudden relief since this has started. I've had a few sessions and each one has left me feeling a bit better, all in all the pain has gone from 8.5/10 on average to 2/10 on average, which I'm extremely thankful for. My concern is will the few more adjustments I have scheduled eventually take this down to 0, or could this be something that needs an Orthopedic specialist? In a very generic sense, could the joint be structurally damaged? I'm really thankful for how much my Chiro has helped me, I just worry that adjustments will only get it so far. I'd like to get back to squatting and deadlifting but I really worry that even if the pain seems low, that could trigger whatever is going on again and take me back to square 1.",SI/Piriformis pain; is Chiropractic work enough for full recovery?

30,Chiropractic,"I know that's a loaded question. I'll start by saying, I'm not a chiro naysayer. My husband has some nerve damage/loss of sensation in his leg and was having some pretty rough neuropathy and he tried chiro after the neurologist just wanted to throw gabapentin at him. It worked. The pain is gone, the rest remains but we were never expecting a miracle.  


Anyhow...I've also started going. I'm probably about 3-4 months in and don't have any specific complaints other than being 40 and out of shape. My neck is my problem child and is perpetually tight, I also have two fused bones in there, but I've been told it's a common thing and probably isn't causing me issue. I was going a few times a week to start but am down to twice a month (my insurance only covers so many visits!). A typical visit seems to be about 2 minutes or adjustment, 10 on the traction table and DONE! I'm not sure the traction does much, I've never had a visit without it. Right now it's covered under my copay but when I run out of visits I think it costs almost $20 plus another $30 for the adjustment.  


The doctors we see rotates and each one seems to be a little different. One in particular seems to take a smidge of extra time with me and I find it noticeable. She does something akin to a massage before she adjusts my neck and does this ""hug"" type adjustment that is amazing. ...but she's not always there and even that is not always constant if they're busy.

Is that normal for care, am I expecting the wrong thing? One of the other doctors remarked on my neck and said my jaw was off but nothing different was done that visit. My favorite was talking about adjusting her boyfriend (also a chiro) and talked about doing ""an hour of work"" and while I certainly don't expect that for my $30 copay, it did get me wondering if I'm missing out.

I‚Äôve been suffering with upper back / shoulder blade / chest pain for 6 months now. 

Clear x-rays for the chest and doctor has me in PT which hasn‚Äôt done anything in a couple of months. 

So I decided to go to a chiropractor, being skeptical and actually told not to bother by my GP, it was a big step. 

So my first taste, I had a physical check over, hips, spine, neck and other locations and then did a strange thing where I had to close my eyes with my arms out in front and March high knees - I ended up totally rotated and at the other side of the room without realising! 

I then had an X-ray of my spine from the side and one from the front with my mouth wide open. 

It was informative, and I go back tomorrow to get my results and start a treatment plan. 

The only thing that concerned me a little was the doctor spent some time selling me a package to have 12 weeks worth of treatment, starting at 2 per week for the first 6 weeks and then less and less as time went on - it felt a bit ‚Äúsalesy‚Äù. 

Looking forward to the treatment and hopefully finally getting some relief.",First time for me today..

You prob face patients like this all the time...

Here‚Äôs the no.1 tips that I learned to increase patients‚Äô experience

So they can give you good testimonials, good reviews and refer you to their friends and family.

You have to treat your patients like a human.

You get to find find out your patient‚Äôs ‚Äòwhy‚Äô,

When they first come to your practice, ask them:

‚ÄòBefore taking your insurance, mind if I ask you a few questions first to see if I can actually help?‚Äô

Why are they here at your clinic? What have they tried? What works? What doesn‚Äôt?

What‚Äôs their goal?

and show them the transformation

Show them how you are going to help them.

Show them how their life will be after you helped achieve their goal.

Show them how you helped people like him to go through the process.

You don‚Äôt just crack their back, their neck,,,

You treat people who have fears, dreams and feelings.

They are not coming to Chiro just to get rid of knee pain, or go back to cross fit.

They are coming to you because the way crossfit makes them feel,

They want to go back to crossfit or play the sport they like because that makes them feel good.

If you are able to treat your patient like a human.

Make them feel like they are being treated like a human.

Not a cash generating tool.

Then, you‚Äôll start seeing more and more referrals coming to your practice.",‚ÄòI wish I knew all these before I even start my own Chiro practice‚Ä¶‚Äô
60,Chiropractic,"If you are a Chiro practice owner, I have something to share with you.

I saw a lot of practice owner trying different marketing strategies,

But only a handful of them actually are able to make it work.

I found that the biggest difference between them and the rest of their competitors is that they have a compelling USP.

A Unique Selling Proposition

They understand who they are trying to convey their marketing message to before they even start marketing their clinic.

They know who their dream patient is

And they understand how they are able to help their dream patient.

All they do is create a specific marketing that speaks to their dream patient.

When their dream patient sees it, their mind would be  ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs exactly my problem‚Äô, ‚ÄòHe totally gets me.‚Äô

So how do you create a USP?

In my understanding, USP is a clear statement describing what you do and how you can solve people‚Äôs needs.

An example would be: At ABC Physical Therapy, we help active people in XYC locations stay fit, healthy and mobile without pain medication, injections or surgery.

It clearly demonstrates to those people what you can help them with and what you can help them avoid.

In a language that your dream patient understands.

And I found most of those successful practice owners will put their USP on their website, their promotional materials, and even somewhere visible at their clinic.",Here's what I learned...

66,Chiropractic,"So I've been getting neck pain/shoulder pain for a while, doctor has been no good in this matter other than typical rest and painkillers. 

So I've decide to give the local chiropractor a go - thinking perhaps it's just a snap and crack thing that needs to happen. After the consultation, x-rays, photos taken, etc, he shows my report showing my hip is not level, with a 6mm drop on one side, this is causing my spine to curve over - as my body compensates - this putting pressure on the vertebrae and related pain around neck and shoulder. 

He did manipulation, but also his staff got me to do a few exercises like the power plate with weights on one side of the head, and a contraption that pulls your chin, chest into a good posture. I need to go back quite a few times to get myself back into alignment apparently.

He said the manipulation he does is mostly an instant relief thing, but it's important to get my spine re-aligned with these exercises to treat root of the problem. 

Whenever I read about chiropractic, there's always those articles that cast doubt over it, but how everything has been explained and shown to me by this guy makes sense.

74,Chiropractic,"Since ~5y I‚Äôm suffering under a lot of neck pain due to muscle tension, especially the left trap. While working out I often injured my right shoulder joint (tendonitis). 

After some time I got diagnosed with a true LLD via Scanogram of the legs. You can measure each bone individually and the result is, that my right leg is in total 1,5cm shorter. 

In addition i got pretty bad posture (forward roled shoulders, forward head, straight neck).

Since I‚Äôm wearing full length shoe lifts (6 Months Indoor &amp; Outdoor) my stance feels more balanced (my weight is not shifted to the right side anymore). 
Lower back pain when standing for long time got way better. 

But my neck pain / tension got worse. 
In addition to that - whenever I try to stand or sit upright, with my shoulders pulled back and doing a slight chin tuck, something in my back cracks very loud when I take a deep breath. It repeats with every 2-3nd breath while maintaining upright posture. 
When I put my hands over my traps I can feel the pop only on my left side, below the collar bone &amp; tissue. 
So my guess is, that maybe the first or second left rib is slipping / popping due to the tension around my neck / upper back. I think it might be the costovertebral joint since it‚Äôs coming from the back not the front of the ripcage. 

Since I‚Äôm adapting to a new body static with my hips being levels again - my muscle imbalances still pulling my spine back. Could that be the culprit? What can I do for a proper diagnosis? Every doc told me that this popping is nothing to worrie about but it‚Äôs driving me nuts. It occurs literally every 2-5min and can‚Äôt be normal. It doesn‚Äôt hurt but the tension increases after.

I started seeing a chiropractor to try to avoid having back surgery for a L5 S1 Injury. They wanted to do a fusion with a cage and all that fun stuff. I have 6 subexations  In my spine and my neck is off a few degrees, the disks are getting close to touching. I haven't had my grains for about 4 or 5 years, I used to get them about once a year and they would send me to the ER with emergency spinal taps and all that fun stuff.

As of late I have been getting a migraine about every 3 to 4 weeks weeks. I don't think there is severe as they usually are but it still seems kind of odd. I am doing multiple different types of exercises for my neck, including the denner roll, and something where I stretch my neck from a door from a device that braces the back of my head and under the chin.  I am unsure the name of it. 

Anyways, is this pretty common or anything to be worried about?  I almost wondered if my neck was getting so bad that maybe it was preventing me from getting my migraines, for whatever reason that may be. Maybe now that I'm stretching my neck and kind of opening up the disks maybe I'm starting to get the migraines that I originally had before? I hope not but it sure sucks.",migraines after care?

86,Chiropractic,"Hi! So, long story as short as I can keep it: I‚Äôm 28F and have been dealing with episodic vertigo, dizziness and tinnitus for about 2 years. I‚Äôve already seen multiple ENTs, neuro-ontologists and neurologists; I‚Äôve also done PT, seen an allergist, had multiple tests done, had extensive blood work, etc.

I also briefly saw a Blair chiro, but had a bad experience (he was very sales-y, using words like ‚Äúcure‚Äù and ‚Äúrelieve‚Äù very loosely among other things). I‚Äôll be honest, he turned me off chiro for a while. Recently, my current acupuncturist  (who‚Äôs covering for my main one who‚Äôs away on leave) recommended atlas orthogonal for me. She recommend this because it‚Äôs really helped her with similar symptoms. And even when I went to PT, I was told how off my C1 and C2 are and know how incredibly tight my neck and traps are. 

I was apprehensive, but did my research and found an AO near me. I have to say, I really like him so far. He‚Äôs not sales-y at all, not making me any big promises (unlike the last guy), and is very generous with his time. He adjusts the atlas, of course, but he‚Äôs also trained in trigger point therapy, which he incorporates in his treatment. I love that, as I went in knowing how big of an issue trigger points are for me. 

That said, while I‚Äôm glad I found someone I‚Äôm comfortable with, I want to make sure I‚Äôm being objective in determining how effective this ends up being for me. I‚Äôve already tried multiple things and spent a lot of money, so I‚Äôm very cautiously optimistic. 

So far, I‚Äôve only done 2 sessions. I know these trigger points are really bad and need to be dealt with, so im hopeful for that aspect, but I‚Äôm not yet sure how helpful the Atlas adjustment itself will be.  

 Few days after my 1st adjustment, I had an unexpected dizzy episode where I had really bad head pressure + throwing up. I don‚Äôt think this was necessarily the adjustment‚Äôs fault, as I had also been running + I‚Äôll admit I did some extra trigger point work on my own, so I think it was all too much for my body at once, which my acupuncturist also said. 

Anyway, would 3 months be a fair amount of time to really give this a chance? (I‚Äôve heard mixed things on how long it should take to help, if it does, so that + knowing neurological issues can be more complex is how I came at 3 months)",How long is fair (on average) to give Atlas Orthogonal a chance?

98,Chiropractic,"Hello! This is my first post here, and I'm posting because no amount of Google searching has given even semi-helpful information. So, when I switched to my current chiropractor a couple years ago, while discussing my x-rays and records, he told me one of my issues is that my right hip is disconnected. From my memory, he said that the front and back aren't connected like they should be, or something similar. 

This made sense to me because I've always had problems with my right hip -  it can easily roll out/partially roll out of joint when I sit in certain positions. Very painful, but can't do anything about it and it just slowly shifts back by itself as I limp around and/or sit. Has never happened with the left hip as my left hip is normal.

Anyways, what the heck would my hip condition be called??? I was gonna search for good exercises to perform with it, but when I search for the correct terminology, all I get are results for ""dislocation,"" ""subluxation,"" and ""hip dysplasia"" - none of which describe my problem.

At the time, I was on a subsidized insurance plan which covered chiropractic care. I went into said Chiro has a consult, evaluation, and x rays done and I was set up for 25 overall adjustments over the course of some time.

Heres the thing. Ive already paid them close to 3 grand in services - yet the original insurance carrier has covered almost everything. In march they billed my insurance 6,073 dollars. I saved $3,630.00 dollars with in network services and Blue Cross covered $1,942.98. I was left with the potential of a 500 dollar bill looking back at the paper work.

130,Chiropractic,"Well, I lost $80 yesterday.

I have tailbone pain stemming from my pregnancy. Been dealing with it for about 6 months. It‚Äôs awful. Sitting is painful. Getting up from a seated position is painful. I just want relief. I have no other symptoms.

My OB had suggested I go see a chiropractor. I should have asked for her recommendation, because I‚Äôve never been to one before. I have always sort of been in the ‚Äúchiropractors are witch doctors‚Äù camp, but everyone I know swears by chiropractic treatments so it can‚Äôt be a total sham, right?

Well, I look online at the chiropractors in my area. The highest rated one happens to be one that a friend of mine is obsessed with. I ask her about the place. She says they have a ‚Äúneurological approach‚Äù (whatever the hell that means) and she not only goes there but takes her baby there. 

So whatever. I make my initial ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù appointment. It was yesterday. 

As I‚Äôm waiting to speak with the ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù I notice he‚Äôs doing adjustments incredibly fast. Like, not even spending 5 minutes with people. He also got fussy with one patient who had stopped coming regularly.

During my consultation, he spends a lot of time talking about the nervous system and things like chemical stressors and subluxations. My tailbone pain, the ONLY symptom out of the million symptoms on his intake form, feels like an afterthought. He also would ask questions, not to build rapport, but for information.

‚ÄúI noticed you didn‚Äôt put your child‚Äôs information on the intake form. Boy? Girl?‚Äù
Girl.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù
I tell him her name, reluctantly.
‚ÄúOh cute!‚Äù

As I‚Äôm doing the ‚Äúthermal imaging scan‚Äù he asks what my husband does. He tells me I should bring both my husband and daughter to the follow up appointment where he‚Äôll go over the results of my scan and he‚Äôll devise a treatment plan and payment plan he feels is best. 

I canceled the follow up appointment. This subreddit has made me realize that the heebie jeebies I was feeling were valid.

The problem is that now I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust ANY chiropractor, considering I was skeptical to begin with. But that‚Äôs not fair to all of the, I‚Äôm sure, reputable chiros out there.

So maybe I just need to ask more questions when I‚Äôm calling around.

What questions should I be asking to avoid scams like this? To ensure I‚Äôm dealing with someone ethical/reputable?

169,Chiropractic,"I am an experienced LMT with advanced training and specialization in deep tissue, postural and injury related bodywork. Currently I am working out of a chiropractic office as an IC, and because of some of the things these chiropractors do I have developed a negative view towards the profession.

I have some genuine questions and am seeking genuine answers. I want to better understand the field and be able to work better with colleagues, but the DCs I am currently working with might be some bad eggs.

Disclaimer: I understand every field has bad eggs and massage therapy is no exception. I don't want this thread to turn into a debate between the fields, as I am trying to develop more respect for chiropractors. 

1) What are the limitations of/for chiropractic care?
The pervasive attitude of DCs I've come across is that they think they can fix everything, and can be fairly condescending towards Massage Therapists, viewing it as no different or better than any passive therapy treatments like ultrasound or stim.  This is the biggest issue I have.

2) Why do chiropractors not refer clients out? Every chiropractor I've met is completely okay with clients coming in 1 to 3 times per week/Month with no improvement or change in their symptoms. 

I have had over two dozen clients stop going to the chiropractors after coming to me for their sciatica only to find that it was pseudo sciatica (piriformis) and not a true sciatic nerve impingement. And that's just one population example. 

3) How frequent do you realistically need adjustments, and do chiropractic adjustments help with soft tissue concerns that could be causing postural distortions found in the body and/or subluxation. Are chiropractors trained in soft tissue manipulation, assessment and treatment or at least how to discern where that treatment is necessary? 

4) From the massage perspective, ligaments aren't meant to be lose or over stretched. Could too frequent adjustment cause a weakening of the ligaments and joint destabilization? 


Those are my main questions. I want to respect chiropractors more. I originally had planned on going to school for chiropractic and found a love for the type of work I do with massage.

I recently started working with a company that his helping me with marketing, online and in office. I've been working with them for a couple of months now and suffice it to say I've been underwhelmed. The biggest problem I'm having is that I told them from the very first call that package deals are something we can't/won't do because - at least the way I understand it, it sets up a dual fee schedule that puts me at odds with the contracts I have with several insurance companies. They continue to pressure me to put together such packages though. The one they are most trying to push for me is ""1 years worth of care for half-off."" There are a couple of problems with that: 1. I only see my wellness patients every 1-3 months, so that's not even that big of a package. 2. I can't do that with acute condition patients because I don't know how long their treatment plan will take without doing an exam. 3. If they're insurance I can't give them discounts on their co-pays. 

I've already consulted my billing company and they are not keen on the idea for the reasons I listed above, but I wanted to get the opinions of other practicing chiros and I know we have at least 1 Utilization Review Doc on the sub. Do any of you do deals like this (1 yr of care for half-off, or 1/2 off an exam), do you do packages? If you do how do you structure the packages to avoid it being a dual-fee schedule? 

I know a lot of DC's do this, I see the ads for them all the time on social media and I assume that either they are cash practices, or they just are more willing than me to roll the dice on not getting caught. I have a meeting scheduled with the CEO of the marketing company tomorrow and they say that he knows insurance contracts (I kind of doubt that, but I'll hear him out) and they say that they have dozens of practices, that also take insurance, and offer these deals without any problems at all.

 My girlfriend and I moved to Dallas from small towns in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho. We didn't visit before sending the move here and it has been absolutely brutal moving into this huge city. I won't get into details about it but my girlfriend doesn't think she can live here anymore, especially for 3 more years. I think I would be fine finishing school here but it is not ideal and would have to sacrifice a lot. And our relationship with terminate. **Suddenly here comes another opportunity for me.**

My family is a chiropractic family and have 15 alumni family members who went to Palmer along with my grandfather who was a long time professor as well as the dean of Palmer while BJJ was still alive and active at school, Dr. Frogley. My mom was at an alumni meeting and brought up my situation. Of course the Palmer rep proposed me transfering to Palmer and set up communication with me. (the reason I chose Parker initially is because of the free school)

Palmer doesn't have as great of a partnership with the VA as Parker does so my tuition would be significantly higher. I haven't crunched numbers yet so I'm not sure the cost difference. However I pay **$1700 in rent in dallas for a 1 bedroom apartmen**t. In Iowa I could buy a house and have a mortgage around or even lower than **$800 per month**. We could have a yard, could garden, have chickens, could keep my 93 classic dodge ram, and enjoy our lives MUCH more. We both are very uncomfortable living in dallas and despise the lifestyle here. 

I haven't pursued anything yet with this transfer but **I am wondering if anybody has done this / how was their experience? Did the school take your credits / classes that you already took in the previous DC program?**

I am also curious on people's opinions of Parker vs Palmer. **Especially the curriculum.** 

Thanks",Transfering Chiropractic Schools?
205,Chiropractic,"So basically had an minor accident at work and went to a chiropractor within a few days due to upper back pain on my left side from an injury to my neck.

After looking up a few reddit posts on what to look out for in a bad chiro, I have found they have done the following:

-Done a x ray and then followed up with a report with bunches of lines pointing out bad curvatures and even a number for the amount of extra weight which I was putting on my neck due to bad posture. 

-Asked if I had been in a car accident before.

-Tried an upfront payment which i declined.

-Every session has been the same adjustments and I‚Äôm  out within 15 minutes.

My right side has always been fine, which I‚Äôm now in pain to what I think was one of my sessions and I‚Äôve been having bad headaches as well to the point where I‚Äôm getting a mri done tomorrow.

I will no longer be going however I am worried that I have serious neck issues, mainly due to this ‚Äúnumber‚Äù of extra weight which is apparently putting extra strain on my neck. Should I be worried or is this just a scare tactic?","I think I‚Äôve been seeing a bad Chiropractor, what should I do now?"

i've been having a pretty scary symptom lately after getting adjusted at the chiropractor and i want to know if anyone else had this issue. 
so i went to an upper cervical chiropractor on June 15th and was told i have a misaligned atlas. i've gotten two adjustments so far and i've been having this weird symptom of whenever i bend my chin down towards my chest i get this rush in my head and in my body. like a lightheadedness but not the same as when you stand up and get lightheaded it's an uncomfortable sensation to say the least. 
i also experience muscle twitching in my neck and head along with the rest of my body. 
i talked to two different chiropractors and they both said this was normal and it's my muscles / nerves getting used to the new placement in my body. my neck muscles feel looser than they used to when i would try to stretch my neck when they were very tight.

211,Chiropractic,"Hello folks! I wrote about a month ago when I was about a month into seeing a chiropractor and I had an awful adjustment that my body reacted to. It was corrected later and I didn‚Äôt feel the sick symptoms I had that night, but A whole bunch of new things have happened. In a nutshell my body appears to be doing fascial unwinding on its own and I also feel like all my bones or joints are very unstable, and I just have absolutely no idea what kind of doctor to go to or who is supposed to be helping me or answering questions. The backstory is below, I apologize in advance that it is lengthy but I beg anybody to please at least point me in the right direction or offer any insight you may have.


about a week after my last post and a few hours after doing a new morning yoga stretch that kept me in the position for a bit longer than usual, my body started doing this involuntary movement that I gave into and ended up rotating different limbs for hours. For a few days I kept googling trying to understand what the hell was happening because it felt like a ribbon unwinding in my body And even opening up some new space, but I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Eventually landed on fascial unwinding which I had never heard of and everything I have read thus far implies that people only do it when they are manipulated by a myofascial release therapist. For the first week or two I would have to give in to the little wave that I could feel in my body but after that I started waking up in the middle of the night unwinding for hours on end. But I still don‚Äôt see a difference aside from one night a crease literally opened up in my stomach that must have been crushed from me being slumped in poor posture. (From what I have learned about the fascial layer it hardens or twists because of bad posture, chronic stress, and sedentary lifestyle‚Ä¶ All three of which I participated in for over a year during the pandemic.)

I am now almost 2 months into going to the chiropractor and not only do I not feel like anything in my body improved but I feel like my bones are literally floating. Like when I do a downward dog position for example, I sit back down afterward and I can literally feel like my entire rib cage or something come back down from being all the way up from my shoulders. And my body will slightly move as it‚Äôs settling back in its place. I feel so unstable like if I even leaned on my side for a bit that all my bones would fall to that side. I slept with my head on the pillow and neck hanging off the other night And woke up with my collarbone feeling either flipped or caved in and a bone sticking out of place in my shoulder creating a bump. The chiropractor said I put two bones out of place.

I had been going to a chiro who does the gonstead method and at one point switched to someone else because the first guy only was seeing me once a week and not explaining much and I felt that I should probably be seen more than that based on what people say. Definitely got caught up in one of the pre-payment plan overzealous generic crackhouse kind of places and did 12 seemingly useless sessions and now I‚Äôm back to my old guy. I also saw a myofascial release therapist and it seemed to make my mood better but all three of these people cannot seem to answer my questions or provide me a thorough explanation of what is happening to me or why. The therapist told me it‚Äôs good that I am unwinding but didn‚Äôt offer any further info. The crackhouse chiropractor told me I am 1 in 1000 for unwinding on my own and offered me some YouTube videos of chiropractors manipulating their patients for the unwind, but also gave me zero other info. Why the hell do my bones feel like they are floating? Am I getting messed up more? Is this a part of the process? I truly don‚Äôt understand what is happening and I am so frustrated with the lack of knowledge. My brother‚Äôs girlfriend is in med school to be an osteopath and suggested I see an osteopath who specializes in osteopathic manipulative medicine. I found someone who does that and acupuncture that I will see in two weeks and perhaps they will give me some type of info.

If you didn‚Äôt see my last post, the reason I went to a chiropractor is because I have been dealing with stomach bloating and gurgling issues for over a year. Tried a million docs and tests and went to a chiropractor who gave me an x-ray and we found that my neck curves the opposite way, my shoulders are tilted and my hips are tilted the other way from my shoulders .

I will say my stomach issues have been mainly gone during these last two months aside from when I get an uncomfortable adjustment that would bring it back until the next adjustment, but since messing up my shoulders I have been dealing with my stomach issues all week. I also want to mention that one adjustment last week I was feeling numb and tingly in different ligaments and at one point my entire legs felt like they were fully filled with concrete. I have explained this info to both chiropractors and have asked multiple times if they are sure it is OK I can be adjusted and they keep saying yes and adjusting me. I have no idea if I should stop or not and I just need help please y‚Äôall",Fascial unwinding happening involuntarily + bones feel like they‚Äôre floating kind of

229,Chiropractic,So my girlfriend has pretty bad lower back pain and seems to only feel relief when I put a lot of weight on her tailbone. Due to this I suggested she see a chiropractor because while I do think they try and oversell how effective they are there are definite cases they can be very helpful and I figured it was worth a shot. Anyway she goes and they take X-rays and tell her that she has a straight neck( what I‚Äôve also seen as military neck) and that if she doesn‚Äôt get it corrected she will very likely( according to them 96%) have degenerative bone problems later in life. She told me that her chiropractor asked her if she was a C-section baby and she said she was and according to him that is the cause of her straight neck. The thing is she has no neck pain/problems which I thought it a little weird the chiropractor decided to focus in on that when she does have really bad lower back pain and that‚Äôs why she came in the first place. So not only is my question can a C-section actually cause a straight neck but also if she has no pain does it matter.,Can C-sections cause a straight neck?

235,Chiropractic,"An in-house mental health clinician is something that really appeals to me, but since it doesn't seem to be very prevalent I'm assuming there are things about it that don't work. Counseling resources are dire these days, so it'd be interesting to see if a one-stop shop model could work. There are already plenty of practices that meet the social/community building  prong, like those that do a lot of successful classes or events and maybe those that are attached to a gym/crossfit. And certainly there are federally qualified facilities in mainstream medicine that do wrap-around supports in this way, but they are abysmally under-resourced and have so many stipulations tied to their funding. In a private practice it would seem easier to implement, given that (I believe) commercial health insurance plans must cover both mental health and chiropractic to be Affordable Care Act compliant. 

Outside of that I could see worksheets/educational materials serving a purpose, but maybe too much of a half-measure. Motivational interviewing helps, but it takes time to build that skill, and of course it would be out of scope to venture into real trauma territory. 

Expecting radio silence as always, but I'd be glad to hear about anything exciting people are doing in this realm! Or failed attempts/learning experiences.

Been two or three weeks now and I still can't tilt my head much to the right. Muscles are always tense and they spasm hard again when i move certain ways.  
Other than the crepitus, I did not have any problems in my neck that I was aware of.

Can we go back to the patient and his attorney and ask that his assignment of benefits to them be rescinded in order for us to keep treating?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/usx5to/giving_notice_prior_to_leaving_my_current/

So I gave a 6 week notice to my employer when he got back from vacation and was met with disgust and noted that I ""lacked character"" etc. Afterwards I continued work as if there was nothing different, greeted and bid good evening to the boss and his wife each morning/evening. 

I was given the cold shoulder and wasn't spoken to unless I initiated the conversation (but this was expected and I didn't have much of a problem with it). As soon as I turned in my notice the relationship soured and I was bad mouthed to the CAs which would always tell me everything since they liked me and I treated them well. 

 Two weeks after my notice I asked if I could take two days off at the end of the week to have a vasectomy performed while I still had insurance. He responded with an ""are you (freaking) kidding me, I told (wife's name who is our office manager) you would do this (crap)"". I simply asked for time off to get this done and wanted to know if he was okay with it. After going through a tirade of telling his wife that I had the audacity to go have a second vasectomy (not true btw, I only had a consult last year after my second kid). He told me that evening that this would be my last day so he could focus on his own thing and because I was asking off work. I just found out today that they canceled my insurance before I could get my vasectomy done.

I never submitted my CEs or relicensing fees to be reimbursed even though they are covered in my contract. I'm also entitled severance pay upon termination of one month per my contract. This guy and his wife have always had a terrible attitude and never spoke well of any previous employees (or patients for that matter). I thought it might be different though because I never gave any problems, always showed up to work and did my job, even when I had minor procedures performed on the same day. Never took all of my PTO in a single year while I was employed with him.

Was it crappy to ask for a couple of days off to get a vasectomy during my final 6 weeks? maybe... I still had 10-12 days of PTO left that are part of my benefits package for working there. The timing of it was most convenient for me with the move coming up and working at the clinic every other Saturday morning.

Regardless, I figured at this point I'll wait for my final check to come in the mail and then I'll see if they included my severance check (which I know they won't). I'll then submit for reimbursement for my CEs and my severance pay.

What if they try and deny my severance pay and CEs/relicensure fees? Just seek out a labor law attorney?

Thanks for letting me vent to y'all, I'm glad to be out of there and moving to a new position and location. I probably wouldn't have mentioned any of this if I could've just kept my (and kids) insurance through the end of the month.",Follow up to leaving associate position.

I was instantly healed and for months fine until the tension came back and I saw him again. I was healed.

Unfortunately, I always had my visits very spread out and over the years the relief has been more brief. He is strange in a sense because he‚Äôs never pitched a treatment plan. He‚Äôs never diagnosed anything. I just go in he pops the C1 in place and that‚Äôs it.

I know I could always work in a clinic but I heard the pay is significantly less (including benefits and stuff) and it takes away that stability aspect. I also see a lot of physio working in interdisciplinary teams really only teach and watch exercises solely as a treatment approach. I also don't think that I would be satisfied with doing this. 

On the other hand, I feel like chiro school would be a good opportunity since I could really develop my manual therapy techniques. I think it fits better what I am looking for out of a career compared to physio. However, as a chiro, I feel like you can only work in a clinic (hospital jobs are rare) and the population you treat is not that varied (you pretty much mostly work with back and neck pain)

I get that chiro is more tuition and more schooling (it's 4 years instead of 2 years) but I rather choose something I love for the long haul and at the end of the day the money difference doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to me. What do you guys think? Any advice would be appreciated! 

On a side note, I have seen many people in this sub recommend physician assistants. I got in that too (I had no idea what I wanted out of a career when applying) but am shying away from that since I really don't want my scope limited by someone else and rather not be 50 years old working under a 30-year-old doctor.",chiro vs physio

345,Chiropractic,"The title is vague, let me explain. Basically, I've been seeing a chiropractor for a few years now. I was consistent initially when it was helpful with most of my then problems (migranes, sleep, neck pain, etc). I started seeing him less over the last 2 years. Things got better it didnt make much of a difference if I went or not, so I started going as and when I felt the need. It's pricey and I don't feel like spending so much money now that things are pretty manageable for me. Not to mention it's difficult to get appointments and I have to travel a lot too. However, I still get that annoying upper back ache that doesn't go away easily. No foam roller or pillow under my back is really helping either. I know just one visit to a chiropractor and this will be done and dusted, my back will feel free again for a few months at least! But I don't want to be dependent on chiropractic help too. It's not painful, it's just uncomfortable. Is there anything someone can suggest I do to help myself at home or would you recommend still seeing a chiropractor?

372,Chiropractic,"Hello, I‚Äôm a relatively healthy 33F who over the last few months has been dealing with a painless clicking sound every time I turn my head to the right, and then back to center. Sometimes it is louder than others, I think depending on how tense I am and how aware of the clicking I am in that moment. Sometimes I don‚Äôt notice it at all but when I‚Äôm in a completely silent environment it drives me insane. Sometimes when it is worse I notice more clicking or almost like a faint sandpaper sound in my neck too. Every few weeks I‚Äôll have a day where I notice a louder sandpapery sound that is very unsettling, but it typically goes away within a day. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if those episodes correlate to periods of higher stress.

I‚Äôve been going to a chiropractor for a few months who doesn‚Äôt seem to have done much for the issue, nor do they seem concerned/treats it like no big deal/shrugs it off even though it‚Äôs very much affecting my mental health. Same with the osteopath I‚Äôve seen. I also went as far as to see a spine specialist. They took multiple X-rays and ruled out stuff like instability/hyper mobility, and said my cervical spine looked totally fine and also told me not to worry about the noise.

I suppose I am just stubborn for not listening to the pros when the tell me not to worry, but it‚Äôs hard not to. I mean - it is my neck! I‚Äôve also noticed some clicking in my jaw lately which I am worried could be related however I also suspect it could be realtors to bruxism I developed from taking a medication. 

Anyways - last week I had a consultation with a NUCCA chiro. We went through my recent X-rays and noticed some misalignments in my cervical and lumbar spine. When I described the clicking to him his explanation was that the spine obviously isn‚Äôt moving correctly. The treatment plan he offers looks like $625 up front which sees reasonable after browsing this sub. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the money. I‚Äôm really interested to see what the atlas X-ray would show. I‚Äôm hopeful that the targeted treatment would help me resolve the issue (and help me just feel better in general and I do have various other aches and pains). However, I am nervous that the treatment could somehow make the noise worse? Does anyone here think that would be possible?

First appointment was told I needed to come twice a week for six weeks, then after that once a week till I hit 28 appointments and then she‚Äôd do a reassessment.

First adjustment felt straighter and my lower back later. Basically she cracked my neck and rolled me around really roughly on my side. Following day feeling a full pain in lower back. 

Been going back as I keep thinking next time that pain I never had will get better. She said she would be more gentle and still doing same movements.

Kept seeing an add on Fb so decided to try it after seeing great reviews. They did 3 scans which I will post the picture of the scans below in the comments since I can‚Äôt post text and picture here. They are saying basically that her nervous system is in parasympathetic mode and with give or take 84 adjustments her nervous system will be completely back to normal where it will be able to function properly like it used to. She‚Äôs gone from fearless to scared of everything, picking her fingers raw daily and not progressing anymore in school and I would much rather do something like this IF it‚Äôs legit over a dr who may just give her anxiety meds but I don‚Äôt see how they would address her progressing issues and probably just blame it on her Down syndrome. She‚Äôs always progressed faster than normal and just slowly stopped so this would be a great thing if they seem legit. As the picture shows they did an HRV test, a rolling thermal NCM test and a static EMG amplitude test. She did wiggle from it tickling her on the part where it shows the extremely long red line at her side and couple lines by her should so that did affect it some but she did not move on the neck part. They have a pay by appt plan but said they offer payment plans which one is prepayment, one is down payment with monthly after and the other is monthly. They of course say it‚Äôs to make it more affordable and does take some of the price down so it does look more appealing than $50 per visit 3x a wk with a scan every 12 visits which would be $100.  They also state that in the beginning symptoms may worsen as the body ‚Äúdetoxes‚Äù and gets rid of the anxieties etc that affect the patient but that the scans will be able to show that there‚Äôs improvement and that it‚Äôs supposedly, matter of fact I will post a picture of that page below too.

Now that I think about it, it was also a way for me to seek their approval and also build my pride. 

However, it is now that I got accepted into chiropractic school and started to prepare for it where I start to regret my decision. 

I have a sheltered mind where I don‚Äôt really think throughly on things and simple rely on others to make the decision for me, and now with this decision that I ‚Äúmade‚Äù for myself, I‚Äôm slowly eating the consequences. 

Now thinking about it, it was very naive of me to think getting a chiropractic degree is enough. I now realize that it‚Äôs more than that: my whole life would be under their control since most of my financials comes from them, meaning I don‚Äôt get much freedom, lack of a social life because I‚Äôd be spending time studying, and I would have to manage all of her patients, live up to her name (being referred as ___‚Äôs kid instead of building my own brand), and also eventually taking over the business (which involves a lot of logistics and entrepreneurship) and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready for that, or if I want to be forever under that.

I just graduated a week ago, and I haven‚Äôt started chiropractic school and I‚Äôm already regretting it, and I feel that it‚Äôs too late to backtrack since I‚Äôve already gotten accepted to the school and my parents already are pouring so much money on me. But at the same time, I feel that the pressure and stress would not be good for my mental health to the point where I might actually become depress in school. 

But another thought is, what would I be doing with an undergrad health communications degree? I‚Äôm scared to quit now and have no other plans to go into because I have no idea what I like doing. Then I will be an absolute failure. 

Should I talk to my parents about my thought process when they have already invested so much money?

449,Chiropractic,"I've been in practice as an for a few years at my current clinic. My current employer requires me to give three months (he's personally requested 6 months in the past) notice in my contract or I forfeit my bonuses for whatever length of time I'm still there (probably only like 1.5-2k in this scenario). I just got a job offer in my hometown in a different state, but they need me by the end of July. So I'm effectively giving him about 6 weeks notice and I feel bad for putting him in a bind bc now he's going to have to work his butt off to see all of these patients until he finds another DC.

A little context here. Currently I make a good base salary of 72k plus a bonus structure (that I've tried to renegotiate with him) of $4 per patient visit. So I made about 90k last year. I tried to do a % of my billed collections, but he said that's too much extra work for him and his wife, so he shot it down the few times I proposed it. When we resigned terms of another three year contract he initially agreed to bump it up to $5 but stated a few months afterwards agreeing to these terms that I'd be getting too much of a raise and that I'd have to take a bump from the previous $3 to $4 per visit.

Fast forward to now and this clinic that is back in my hometown where I'd prefer to live (due to friends and family, my kids would also have cousins etc.) Is offering me a 100k salary and 25% of everything collected off of my billing after I reach that base salary. I'd be working alongside an FNP and would be the only DC in the office. My wife would also love to move back so I'm definitely taking the job based on the above info. I just got the offer this week but he's out of town on vacation. So I have to wait to tell him until Monday.

Basically I'm curious what most people here consider to be a long enough resignation period. I really don't see a way to not take this offer since I'm going to get a significant pay raise (calculated to be about a 40-50% pay raise) and will be living where I'd like to be. 

I have to do what's best for me and my family, and since he doesn't really want to change my pay by any significant measure (Not to mention supplying DME to any patient that has a met deductible or decent coverage for it... I feel dirty and unethical doing so since he requires me to give them to anyone that has any type of low back pain or ""uneven pelvis"").

460,Chiropractic,"Hey chiros. I recently had a strange nerve problem happening in the rhomboid muscle behind my right shoulder blade. I'd been to a chiropractor in the past for a slipped rib, which was fixed in just one visit, so I figure it was time to seek out help from a chiropractor in a new city I had moved to.  


I found this clinic just down the street from me. Before they would even adjust or look at my back, they insisted on x-rays. I had them done, was told I had a straight back and neck, and that I needed to sign up for a three month program with multiple adjustments per week. I caved. I thought I was doing the right thing for my health and my body.  


Long story short, after two weeks of adjustments, my back has progressively felt tenser, in more pain, and worse. Especially in other areas of my neck and back that had no problems before. They're also pushing these ""Max Living"" supplements and seminars on me (which after reading this subreddit has convinced me to cancel my membership). The office also feels like a cattle mill - you do these stretches and chair exercises - then the Chiro maybe adjusts you for two minutes tops as other members wait their turn in a number system. Posters on the walls talk about how chiropractors can replace your primary care doctors, and how members have been able to quit their prescription meds. The whole thing now feels like a scam, and I'm in more pain.  


I called their office today, and asked that I cancel my membership and receive a partial refund for services no longer desired. The desk clerk said I would be unable to cancel over the phone for ""legal reasons"" as the doctor would need to sit down with me in an office and explain my case to me. She said something about how it was bad for me to leave without knowing what work I needed to do. I told her it felt like that practice was a way to pressure me to continue, and I did not want to talk to a doctor. So their cancellation practices feel scammy too?

I went and saw this chiropractor over the weekend. On the internet, I saw that he had a complete clinic. However it seems that in recent years, that office has been ""taken away"" and he doesn't even accept insurance at this point despite his name being listed on the insurance company's website. This initial visit was a $100 charge and subsequent visits will be $50 each. When I visited him, his office was in this one building in the basement and he doesn't even have a sign on the door. His secretary provided me the wrong room number when she texted me after I called. There was a different chiropractic office in the building, so I was confused and almost left to go to his previous address.

He told me that he only works 3 days out of the week, one of those days being a Saturday. This is because he has cancer and is in stage 4 of chemotherapy, causing his body weight to be down. He seemed to do his job fine and I felt significantly improved upon the day afterwards.

I‚Äôm going to be graduating this summer and have some offers I need advice on. I‚Äôve talked to my wife and father extensively about it but they aren‚Äôt in the profession so it‚Äôs a little harder to gauge for them.

Background: new father and want more kids in the next few years so that‚Äôs where my thoughts and priorities are. Also a new home owner.

My first offer is not bad. I get 25% collections with no health benefits and 10 days unpaid vacation. I work 3 nights a week until 7 to 6, 1 night a week until 8, and every other Saturday 8 to 1. This isn‚Äôt bad but limits my time at home and puts stress on my wife to take care of the kids a lot. I also may be able to become a part owner between 7 to 20 years (time frame is very fluid right now). 

My second offer is to associate for 3 years and become the owner. I would work 8 to 4, 4 days a week and no weekends. This is nice because it allows me to have more control over my work but I can see where this adds stress to my home life as well.

One of the biggest issues is the non compete clause. If I work with option 1, I‚Äôm stuck because my wife won‚Äôt want to move outside of the radius and my life timeline will be on counting on this doc to retire which could be a decade or more. It eliminates option 2 completely if I sign on. 

I am really, really unsure where to take my life right now. I want to do the absolute best for my wife and son and they, along with our stability as a family, is my top priority.

Chief concern: 34weeks pregnant moderate-severe upper left rib pain while working with my arms elevated all day, and severe rib pain that wakes me up at night. Some pelvic girdle pain, normal back pain from working.

Adjustments: electric massager lightly up and down spine, back crack, side lying hip twists, neck crack, and activator on rib/sternum 10x after finding tenderness on sternum. Told me the rib was ‚Äúseparated‚Äù. Told to come back asap in a few days.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Appointment 2: Came back a few days later as prescribed

Adjustments:
electric massager lightly up and down spine, Back crack (one audible pop), side lying hip twists (no cracks audible on pelvis, probably due to it being done a few days ago), neck crack, and massaged muscle near the rib/sternum where a muscle spasm was for a few minutes with CBD lotion. Didn‚Äôt use activator today. Told me to massage the area at home and come back if pain doesn‚Äôt fully subside in a week or so. Appointment less than 5 minutes.

I texted her after the appointment asking if it was a separated rib like mentioned last visit, or just muscle pain. 
‚ÄúYou did have a rib out for sure and I did adjust it from the back today, but when I palpated the front I didn't not feel it was an anterior rib issue l, I felt it was a muscle spasm...

Appointment 4:
My chiro is out sick so had someone covering for her. The new chiro was a young graduate that was shadowing at our last few visits. I‚Äôm excited to have a second opinion!
I asked her if she could evaluate my pelvis after my injury and that it hurts most on my pubic bone.

Adjustments:
She did all the same things the regular chiro did in the past, except nothing popped. She then evaluated my pelvis on the front and said I have SPD and the pelvis is locked up. She used the activator on my pubic bone from each side and warned me it was going to be tender, it hurt a TON when she did it but I was happy something was being done about it! She then massaged firmly under my belly (also hurt a ton) saying the muscle under the belly is attached to the pubic bone so loosening it will help. She said it will likely continue to hurt a bit after giving birth.

I asked if I should continue to have this done weekly and she said ‚Äúwell you are 39 weeks, so only if you haven‚Äôt given birth yet‚Äù. Which contradicts her saying it will continue to hurt after birth.

Keep in mind, pain is biopsychosocial and there is a lot involved, however, this paper suggests an interesting ""bio"" link that could be a trigger that could help explain by 1 in 4 people suffer from ongoing pain. In my initial skim of the paper it looks like they're looking at it from an epigenetic (turning genes on/off) perspective, although I could even be wrong about that. Lots of big words, LOL. 

In rodents (and I think this pertains to humans), the acute pain duration was lengthened in the group taking anti-inflammatories. One of the prime tenets of current pain science is to control acute pain by any means necessary as early as possible, which makes some sense given that you can't have chronic pain without it being acute pain in the first place, but this study should give practitioners pause when it comes to the ANY part of ""any means necessary."" 

I think this dovetails somewhat nicely with the recent discussion on ""Will DC's ever go under the AMA"" (which I took to mean will DC's ever have a plenary medical license?) and presents an interesting argument for why a profession's ""philosophy"" is probably more important that certainly Reddit chiros give it. The medical standard for at least NMSK pain ALWAYS involves NSAIDs for all guidelines as first-line treatment. As non-prescribing providers, that's a guideline we can't easily follow and I wonder to what effect that has created temporary, short-term discomfort that has actually greatly benefited patients who weren't already self-administering NSAIDs and maybe there is a good reason for chiropractors to remain a non-drug profession. I'll be curious to watch this research extend into human trials and then see how many decades it takes for medical practitioners to adopt it if it pans out. (sorry, can't NOT be cynical when it comes to these sorts of things). 

I've driven my wife crazy for years because I stubbornly refuse to take NSAIDs myself, saying silly things like, ""My shoulder hurts because I hurt it, not because I am low on NSAIDs"" which drives her nuts. But, for real, in the past 30 years I've used Ibuprofen 800mg for about 1 week when I fractured some ribs and that is the extent of my NSAID use as an adult. I've never thought that it makes sense to suppress inflammation unless it's really out of control and I feel a little bit validated in that, even if it's just one rat study. But on a more serious note, I wonder how many chiropractic patients have benefitted from not immediately being being Rx'd NSAIDs by us.",Blocking Inflammation May Be A Trigger for Future Chronic Pain - and Why Professional Philosophy Matters

513,Chiropractic,"Hi! Heading into a heavy recruitment/growth phase, I was hoping to hear some perspectives on the optimal benefits package; we want to offer the best option we can afford. I have very little experience as a healthcare consumer, but based on doing admin for our practice over the past two years it makes the most sense to me to do a HDHP with good coverage both in- and out-of-network and a company funded HSA covering the full deductible. But I know people have varying priorities when it comes to their healthcare.

What do people look for in a benefits package? What about dependents? Would an HRA be a better choice? For clinicians, would you like having the option to take a higher base salary/split in lieu of group health insurance and shop for your own plan on the marketplace? Is it more attractive to pay a lower portion of the premium than having the deductible covered? I know some options have more tax advantages on the employer side, but our top priority is a clinic culture of support and safety.

515,Chiropractic,"A warning for anybody wanting to go to a chiropractor. My life was ruined by one. I went for a routine adjustment after many years. However it was a cervical adjustment gone wrong. 

The chiropractor sat me in a chair and grabbed my skull by both sides before twisting the head in both directions. 

There was a loud crack from the left to right adjustment. I immediately knew something was wrong. Within 5 minutes of leaving the clinic I had muffled ear. Bh that night a sore neck on the left and tinnitus. Over the course of the next few days I gradually got worse and worse, insomnia, fatigue, headaches, pain behind my left eye and other symptoms. Fully listed below:

Ear and head pressure
Jaw stiffness
Tinnitus
Stiff neck mostly left hand side
Neck grinding a bit
Little bit of a headache
Even my right arm feels a bit off
Trouble sleeping
Sweating a lot at night
Nausea
Tiredness
Tightness in my throat like a lump
A little bit of blurred vision in left eye
Balance was off a little bit

Having contacted the chiropractor he told me my atlas ‚Äúmust be out‚Äù. He said he could fix it. I went back a week later for an adjustment which he performed with an adjusting type spring device.

Having left the clinic I then felt a great sense of euphoria surge through my head. Unlike anything I had ever felt before.

I have never been the same since. Pains up the base of my skull, tinnitus, libido issues, loss of balance and coordination, memory, focus and concentration all affected.

519,Chiropractic,"Hey all, so ChiroOne came to my work and I signed up for a first appointment before seeing all the issues with them online. I still went, got my x-ray, all that.. overall the doctor I saw was pretty nice and helpful but I don't plan to spend my entire deductible on a few weeks of visits.

A bit of info on me, I am 30 years old, female, 5'4"" 140ish pounds, fairly active at my gym and overall healthy. I do have a bad back however, my lower back sometimes can be really stiff especially in mornings, and my upper back near my neck is basically always kind of sore/irritated. I used to go to a chiropractor for a while but he moved and haven't been to one in over a year. I did feel like his adjustments helped, I'd go once a month.

Anyway, the ChiroOne doctor I saw said I have a foreword head posture, and it does make sense. He only x-rayed my neck since that is a constant pain/stiffness unlike my lower back which is more painful but much less often. I am wondering if you all have opinions on this.. is this a real thing, is this what is causing my upper back and neck to hurt most likely, etc, and what can I do? I am willing to go back to a chiropractor but not one that costs that much, however it seems like something I might be able to ""correct"" on my own or at the very least try some things and if it feels better, I know that's the problem.

I'm a personal trainer of 20 years, and perform myofascial release on all of my clients at the end of our sessions.  Recently I had an experience while performing myofascial release on a client that was a bit disturbing to say the least.  

Yesterday I had a 33 year old fit client on his back and I was performing mfr on his chest.  I was using a pvc pipe with a cap on the end to release his upper chest.  I was putting pretty good pressure on him, but no more than any of my other male clients with of his size.  I was pressing in when his chest depressed in what I would describe as a violent release.  I immediately stopped pressing and asked if he was in pain.  He wasn't.  We were bothe more startled than anything.  I palpated and it was sore, but nothing crazy.  I asked him how it felt to flex to make sure the muscle fibers weren't damaged and he was fine, he said he felt very little pain.  I asked him to do a push up and again no pain.  We then went out and did some light cable Flys, again no pain.  So I was thinking it was either a crazy release, or perhaps I had just slipped off of a tight fiber bundle.  

Today he came in for a session and it was a push day.  I went very conservatively with him and he said there was a little bit of pain, but nothing to be worried about.  I have asked him to keep me up to date on any new pains or changes in his condition, and he jest messaged me that it was hurting a little bit when he breathed in deeply.  This got me thinking that it could be a rib injury, which I should have been suspecting all along.  

I guess my question is that for those of you with experience with a dislocated or subluxed rib, does this sound like that's what it is?  Have any of you ever had anything like this happen while you were pressing on someone's chest?  If he's mostly pain free, how concerned should I be, etc...

I came back 4 days later because that‚Äôs when he was available when I was scheduling but said I felt good from the last adjustment though I‚Äôd woken up with a little lower back pain in the middle lower area, possibly from a bad sleeping position, but that my hips felt well aligned and good. He wanted to do the same adjustment as before on the side and immediately it didn‚Äôt feel good necessarily.

I had and accident two years ago, that lead me to cervical instability (atlantoaxial instability) and I received chiropractic care after the accident, it was the traditional way of chiropractic. (and I think is the only type of chiropractic care in my country, I live in Mexico) and it helped but not totally, I mean, I still can't lift weight and have a terrible neck, shoulder, jaw and arms pain, even my jaw is in wrong place. I can't turn my head or use a car without a cervical collar. And I have a lot of neuralgias in my face and head.
I started chiropractic care last weak but not traditional way, because the chiro uses the activator tool. 
My question is if this method could help me? 
I'm honestly desperate, sad and kind of hopeless about everything, have been receiving medical treatment but it's only a lot of pills for chronic pain, I miss living life, and my parents and I have treated a lot of therapies but nothing seems to help. 
And also, can Jaw misalignment be the reason why other therapies including chiropractic care (traditional) didn't help?

613,Chiropractic,"Most people know that chiropractors can help with back and neck pain, but what many people don't know is that chiropractic care can also help improve your overall health. Chiropractors are experts in spinal health and can help to correct misalignments in the spine, which can lead to a number of problems elsewhere in the body. Some of those may include headaches, migraines, and fatigue. Here are some common reasons that people turn to chiropractors for help with their health:

1. Chronic back pain is a leading cause of missed workdays or missed time at home with your family. When you experience chronic back pain, it can be difficult to focus on anything else, making it difficult to stay productive at work or be present for your loved ones. A chiropractor can help you find relief from your back pain and restore your ability to focus on what is important in your life.

2. Headaches and migraines are other common problem that many people experience. These painful headaches can leave you feeling drained and unable to enjoy your day. A chiropractor can work with you to identify the root cause of these headaches and provide treatment options that can help reduce or eliminate these headaches altogether.

3. Fatigue is another common problem for many people, especially if they are dealing with chronic pain or illness. If you find yourself feeling excessively tired, it can be difficult to get through your day. A chiropractor can help to improve your overall energy levels and help you feel more rested, so you can better handle whatever comes your way.

4. If you are dealing with a chronic illness, such as arthritis, diabetes, or fibromyalgia, a chiropractor can help to improve your overall health. These conditions can often lead to pain, fatigue, and reduced quality of life. A chiropractor can help to improve your symptoms and help you to better manage your condition.

5. Chiropractic care is also helpful for pregnant women. Many pregnant women experience back pain, which can make it difficult to enjoy the pregnancy and prepare for the birth of their baby. A chiropractor can help to improve your spinal health and reduce back pain, so you can focus on what is important‚Äîyour growing baby.

Is chiropractic treatment more than just back pain? A Tacoma patient asked Dr. Bradley Eyford, a prominent [chiropractor in Tacoma](https://thehealthconnection-tacoma.com/). Dr. Eyford responded straightforwardly:- If you are looking for improved overall health and wellness, consider turning to a local chiropractor for help.

My grandad (78) has had a bad back and hip for 5+ years, nothing unusual there. It was slowly getting worse but he was still fully mobile, didn't struggle to carry shopping or other daily tasks. 


Through the NHS he went to a chiropractor, apparently everything he did was painful, so no specific movement or action stood out from the rest. But come the evening the original hip pain was getting worse and has continued to do so since, to the point he can no longer walk, drive or even sit at the dining table.


It's been around 6 weeks since the appointment, the GP have upped his painkillers and given him tramadol as well. They don't seem to have any interest in why the increase of pain has occurred, they haven't scheduled any examinations or x-rays. So that's why I'm here.

638,Chiropractic,"I went in for an adjustment last week and mentioned to my chiropractor in passing that I had the flu the week before. She asked if I frequently get sick (because I'm a teacher and work around kids all the time) and I said that I do, fairly frequently, about 2 or 3 colds throughout the fall and winter. She then said that she had something that might help with that called Thymus. 

She went and got a sample bottle and had me lay down and raise my left arm up in the air. She put the bottle on my chest and tried to push my arm down while I was able to resist. Then she took the bottle away and pushed my arm down easily. She said that this supplement would be helpful for me and although she didn't have any more in stock right now, would order some for me. This all happened before I really even had a chance to ask what the supplement was. I also have to admit that I am highly skeptical of the arm thing -- I just fail to see why a glass bottle on my chest would have any effect on my ability to push my arm down, or why that would be related to my immune system. 

Finally, before I left, she asked me if I had the COVID vaccine, and I said that I did. She said that it destroys the immune system because of the spike proteins it contains. I replied that I thought the spike proteins in the vaccine helped train immune cells to recognize the virus, and she said yes, but then the immune system can't recognize anything else.

Anyway, her office sent me a message today that the Thymus was in. I wanted to ask here if this is something other chiropractors were aware of and if it could really help with my immune system. I am not sure yet how much it would cost. I also wanted to know if the arm exercise is a real effect, or if there was something else going on.

The chiropractor warned me that there would be some reactions to the adjustment since it's a new thing and my body might be like what the heck?? The first reaction I had was my neck was a bit hot not bad. The day after the adjustment I had a small headache in the morning which went away and then was suddenly super tired in the mid afternoon like 5 ish I just suddenly was so fatigued I feel asleep for 3hrs and it was a struggle to wake up.

659,Chiropractic,"When I opened my practice I always wanted to get involved with the local schools, particularly helping the teachers and staff. I have several family members who work in schools, and I have more intimate details on how they are constantly stressed and overworked. Teachers make great patients, and in my local district they have great chiropractic benefits.

The plan was to set up teacher appreciation days. Now, this is the part you may hate, but you can modify this. I did it a lot when I first started out because I needed to do anything and everything. For the schools I would personally go in and provide 3-4 hours of massages free of charge. You could use terminology like soft tissue work, manual therapy, or whatever, but saying ""massage"" gives certain connotations that people will understand what you are doing. You could go in and do ART or graston clinics if you wanted, I'd just make sure the concept is digestible.

The best way to get in is to contact PTAs. They are the ones responsible for organizing teacher appreciation days, and they are always looking for free options if possible. When you come along offering free massages as part of your ""free community outreach program"", you'll get a lot of bites. They may have a designated person for teacher appreciation, or you may work directly with the PTA president. Either way, this person will be your liaison and connection to the school.

If you can't get a hold of the right person, my next advice is to contact the school secretary. This may be as simple as just calling the school. ""Hi this is Dr K and I was hoping you could give me some advice. I am setting up some free massages for local schools, and I was wondering if you knew who the right person would be to talk to for your school?"" Something like that. More often than not they will start working to schedule you right there, taking down potential dates, or asking a few questions. Secretaries do a lot of computer work and love massages too! Other times they may get me the correct PTA person's phone number, or get me to the principal themselves.

If you want to sweeten the deal you can also cater in food. I try not to make it very expensive, and if there are a lot of staff I generally don't offer (high schools for example). Bringing food does give you a spot to place all sorts of handouts and flyers that everyone can see. I would cater in sandwich platters from Subway, but the prices have probably gone up since then. The variety platters were the best deal versus trying to get individual subs. What I found to be just as appreciated and much cheaper was catering Einstein Bros bagels, again variety packs and variety cream cheeses. Everyone will find something they like, and teachers love the free food.

During the actual massages or soft tissue work, you get to have a nice consult with them. Learn what gives them issues, treat it just like a consult in your office. Then at the end, offer them to come visit you. Maybe you have an incentive if they tentatively sign up while they are with you.

During these events you can get a lot of teachers signed up for new patient exams, and it will make your afternoons very busy when they leave school.

For my school district, I am the guy. I'll still visit schools and drop off goodie bags, but I don't do the massages like I used to. If you are a newer doc trying to brainstorm things to do, this is a great way to spend a morning.",Want to help more teachers? Here is what I did.

686,Chiropractic,"During mid December last year, I was playing a soccer game and went in for a tangle, but extended my left leg laterally, and jamming my hip. I didn't hear a pop or anything like that, so I kept playing on it. After, the side of my hip was very numb and tight and even painful sometimes the rest of the week. Went to physio, he just said that I pulled my hip flexor. Fast forward 3 weeks and I still have the same dull and tight pain on the side of my left hip. Went to another physio and they thought that I might have had a labral tear, so they told me to get an MRI. Got the MRI, and it showed that I had a ""fissure,"" in my labrum. I was told that it was like a partial tear. Immediately physio told me to get PRP which I did not understand. I scheduled an appointment with surgeon to see his opinion. He told me that I should get PRP let alone surgery. He said that my pain was on the left side, and did not show any signs of hip labral tear. He told me to do some PT. PT then told me I had a pelvic tilt, so he spent a couple weeks balancing my pelvis. During my time I felt a decrease in pain, and he told me to start running. Running felt good so after 7 moths almost, I returned to soccer practice. I was told not to do too much too quickly, but after 3 practices of stupid quick turning and excessive shooting, I then started to feel terrible groin pain and pubic pain. This paranoid me because I was reading constantly about how groin pain is associated with labral tear. I kept playing then developed the same pubic and groin pain on my right side, however it was not as painful. I developed osteitis pubis, I was told. Today I'm still doing treatment for the OP, but my main concern now is that my side hip pain has started to come  back really bad, (I always had it but it was very gradual/off-on). My questions are:

1. What was my originally injury?

3. Could my ""fissure"" in my labrum cause all this injury.

My question is basically the title. The chiropractor I've been seeing takes x rays at the beginning and middle of treatment. I've been going since early January because I was referred after a car accident. Researching online now I'm seeing a lot about how unhelpful and unnecessary x rays are for chiropractic care, and that it's often essentially a sales tactic with lots of false promises (this place insists on them). I feel like that is becoming even more clear now, because my x rays from last week show some major issues that weren't even there before. For example my pelvis has become misaligned and my neck at C2 has jumped to the right way out of alignment in the images. I've been experiencing more pain in those areas as well. When I mention it during an adjustment, I've been told that it is normal to feel pain elsewhere as they are realigning my neck and upper back. I did not go into this wanting to simply move the pain elsewhere. Is that actually a normal thing for chiropractic care? The chiropractor even said ""huh"" and ""that's weird"" about my xrays, and then immediately went into a confusing spiel about how we can't expect everything to be getting better because it's only been a short time and that there are some improvements so everything is fine. For reference it has been 4 months, most of which they had me going 3 times a week. The last few weeks I told them it was too often for my schedule and went down to two times a week. Should I be seeing better improvements at this point? I'm really starting to think I've been scammed, but would appreciate professional opinions on this one.

I'm not sure how technically accurate this is (I expect it is probably somewhat of a simplification) but he said the issue is essentially the nerve sending messages to the muscles in your leg is pinched/partially blocked by the pelvis and the slight rotation unblocks it. After this, the messages get through a lot clearer and the 'strength' in both legs is much more similar.

Q1 Is there a name for this type of test? 

Q2 Is the nerve in question the sciatic nerve? 

Q3 How accurate is the above description of what is happening.

Q4 Are there any stretches/similar I could do at home between chiro visits to unblock this? When exercising I often find I have less control in my left leg compared to my right leg (eg it being a lot harder to switch on specific muscles in my left leg). If this last question goes again rule 2, please let me know and I'll remove it.",Pushing down on each leg test

I'm one of those cases where ""I saw something online and now I have questions"". I was watching a documentary about faith healing and its debunking and one of the faith healer's favorite truck was to even out or ""grow"" a leg which was slightly shorter than the other. If course he did this by pouring the individual's legs in the position he wanted and showing them that they appeared to be different lengths.

I'm not casting aspersions here but it makes me question every time I have an adjustment done. I feel that if I were the one seeing my legs where I wanted them, they would be even but I'm expected to trust the chiropractor that he or she is being completely honest about it. It's not that I believe all chiropractors are charlatans but there's still a certain stigma that maybe you can help me overcome. I understand the explanation behind how and why the adjustment works to even out the pelvis but it seems impossible for me to distinguish between an actual need for adjustment and a chiropractor setting me up to come in on the regular.

Bottom line is that my body can‚Äôt handle the physical pressure that comes with being a chiropractor. I‚Äôm in pain all the time and the weekends give my body some reprieve but it‚Äôs not enough to recover. I feel like an exhausted zombie throughout the week. I want to do a career change and go into a career that isn‚Äôt as labor intensive‚Ä¶possibly in management or work from home. But I don‚Äôt want to go back to school and get more student loans. Is there any other career I can go into with a chiropractic degree that isn‚Äôt labor intensive?

I‚Äôm not sure if it helps but I graduated last year and currently work for The Joint and I see about 45 patients a day. I love everything about The joint‚Ä¶the work environment isn‚Äôt toxic, the pay is good, they are helping pay off my student loans, my patients adore me, it‚Äôs fulfilling, etc. My body just can‚Äôt handle the patient load. I make about $85,000 per year. I would like to continue to make the same salary so I can pay off my student loans. I also don‚Äôt have anything saved up to start my own clinic. I am saving for a down payment on a house now and then will start saving for my own clinic after that. But there‚Äôs a long way until that happens. I don‚Äôt think my body can handle this load for more than three more months. I‚Äôm at a breaking point and just trying to survive and make it another day. Any advice would be helpful? Has any chiropractor made a career change before?",I made a mistake by becoming a Chiropractic Doctor‚Ä¶how do I pivot into another career track?

823,Chiropractic,"I had my first chiropractic session ever last week, and after many tears and back spasms am wondering if this is representative of what chiropractic adjustments are supposed to be.

I was referred over to a chiropractor by my midwife after I went in with what I can only describe as crippling sciatica-like pains down my leg. It was bad enough that I had to call into work one morning because I couldn't even crawl to the bathroom that night without screaming in pain.

So at 25wks I went in to see a chiropractor who specialized in prenatal care. She talked to me for about a minute or two about my concerns before getting me face down on the table. 

She was only working on my back a few seconds before she started to hit spots that were triggering extremely painful areas. I immediately started getting those shock cries (those times when something is so painful your body just reacts and tears up). Only a few minutes later, the paper on the table in front of my face was soaked through with tears. While she asked if I was doing okay and changed the paper, overall the chiropractor didn't seem concerned at my level of discomfort. She asked to work on my upper back and hesitantly I agreed. She popped something that made me scream. 

After that, she had me turn to my back so she could adjust around the front of my hips. Maybe a minute later she was done.

All total, the chiropractor worked on me for no more than 10min. She asked that I return the next morning. I did not. I paid the fee and got out. I spent the rest of the day with more spasms in more places than before. If it hadn't been covered by insurance, it would have been $147.

I ended up calling a trigger point therapist masage friend who has since worked on me twice now - each session lasting 30min to 1hr. Both times I've come away being able to walk normally, pain free, and with the feeling that someone took enough time to really work with me.

To me, the chiropractic appointment felt rushed, impersonal and, of course, extremely painful. Is this normally what first visits are like? If it is, how do chiropractors expect cliens to continue returning? If it's not normal, what is?

Thank you. I really try to keep an open mind. So if what I experienced is not a good representation of chiropractic medicine, then I want to know.

P.S. Moderators: your subreddit won't let me spell ""masage"" correctly without marking the two ""s's"" as a swear. :p","Did I experience a ""normal"" first visit?"
824,Chiropractic,I fell at the end of 2020 at work and have been seeing a chiropractor since. Once my back felt better from my fall at work (which took a while) I now still go once a month for maintenance adjustments. Anyways I knew I had a curve in my upper back that always to me seemed too curved. My chiropractor said I have kyphosis. Before I started going to him my back was always so stiff especially in the curved area. I do still sometimes get pain in my lower back where it curves inward to compensate if I lay wrong or something but but usually it‚Äôs not bad now that I get adjustments. My chiropractor says pretty much just live with it unless it‚Äôs debilitating me (which it isnt.) I was just wondering if kyphosis at 32 is something I should be really worried about or if it‚Äôs fine as long as it‚Äôs not bugging me too much? Also is there anything that I could do at home to help if it gets stiff or something or just stiff in general to help?,Is having kyphosis at 32 something I should be worrying about?

828,Chiropractic,"I'm a Parker student who is more than half way through the DC program. Within the last year or so, the school implemented a strict requirement of completing roughly 20 hours of community service (1 credit = 2 hours) in order to graduate. We were told that our licenses, transcripts, and other accounts would be on withheld until we finish those community service hours upon graduation. Normally I'm 100% in support of community service and I think it's a great way to give back. However, we can only acquire credits via opportunities that the school administration creates, which may be far and few in between.   


I'm not sure if other schools also have this kind of requirement. But I find it increasingly difficult to deal with the Parker school administration and their weird rules. There's only 1 or 2 events per trimester and somehow they always end up happening during exam weeks. Personally, I'd rather spend that time practicing my technique instead of spending time manning a table at a school event.

830,Chiropractic,"For those not aware, there is a historical concept in chiropractic technique referred to as ""retracing."" It's still talked about a LITTLE bit today, certainly not as much as there was 25 years ago or before that, in my experience. The basic concept of retracing was used to educate patients who would have exacerbation of symptoms after adjustment, and the explanation was essentially that if you've been in pain for a long time sometimes you have to ""go back through it"" because of the way the nervous system works. Obviously vague, somewhat questionable, doesn't really explain anything. I've never personally liked the explanation. 

Interestingly, the concept of retracing seemed to come up the most with longterm/ongoing pain and a lot less so with more acute patients, and I don't think that is on accident. I think retracing actually is a thing, and there is a modern explanation for it. 

In some longterm/ongoing pain cases, there are nociplastic changes that occur, in other words, the CNS actually undergoes some wiring/firing changes that relate to this process. One of the characteristics of ongoing pain and central sensitization/nociplasticity is something called ""latency."" Latency is, IMHO, what chiropractors traditionally called ""retracing."" In pain patients, latency is a delay between stimulus and response. 

Some examples of how latency looks in a patient case:

* Patient is more active than usual or starts doing their home exercises or whatever and they don't feel symptoms resulting from that until a day or two later. This is part of why there is such a disconnect in these patients between alleviating and aggravating factors because the time delay makes it hard for the patient to connect activity with how the activity felt. 
* Patient has exacerbation of symptoms related to treatment, or testing, even. Classic scenario is if you do much neurodynamic testing/treatment with patients, it often feels fine when you're doing it but then the patient is laid out the next day or two. 

In the pain science world, latency is thought to be coming from an immune response, of all places, which takes time, hence, exacerbation of symptoms 24-48 hours later. Some ongoing pain patients have glial cell changes that affect glial cell activity and their release of cytokines (some of which are pro-inflammatory and some of which are anti-inflammatory, depending on the location of cytokine activity and the types of cytokines). Depending on the patient and their situation, one of the ""super systems"" that overlie their pain experience (which is an output) can be an increased immune system response and the subsequent glial cell and cytokine activity changes that come with that output. I believe these are the patients that have some worsening after adjustments who would have had the ""retracing explanation"" in some chiro offices of old.",A modern explanation for the old school concept of retracing?

She determined correcting my neck to be the most important to improving my back pain and in order to do that recommended a treatment plan of 3x a week adjustments (hip, back, neck) with neck traction for 4 months. I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed like a lot, but I did well the first two months where I felt pain relief after the adjustments. But then I had a period of a month or so where I felt worse after adjustments. I expressed my concern and she had an explanation for it (to summarize, it wasn‚Äôt her it was me.)

I did go to the emergency room last night when my right leg was feeling a little numb, it scared me and the fact that I didn‚Äôt feel a pinched nerve type of pain but I knew I popped my neck in a way I‚Äôve never felt it pop like before, I figured if I pinched a nerve or hurt myself it should hurt worse.

Needless to say, my heart skipped a beat... reached to help her up...  had her just lie there for a moment to see if she was ok.  She stood right up. wiggled her hips and said 'well, there we go!, I think that helped.'   

It was a running joke in the office for a long time.  She would often ask the staff if she could fall off the furniture every once in a while for maintenance care.

Here is what the MRI says:  

C5-6 level demonstrates a large central/right paracentral disc protrusion. Disc protrusion indents the ventral surface of the spinal cord. In the midline, AP dimension of the thecal sac is estimated at 8mm, indicating moderate-severe stenosis. Mild left foraminal narrowing is seen. 

C6-7 level demonstrates a very large, broad left paracentral and proximal foraminal disc extrusion. Disc pathology and measures up to 6 mm in AP dimension and extends about 4 mm below the C6-7 disc space. The disc material almost completely effaces the left ventral subarachnoid space. There is asymmetric indentation upon the spinal cord, left worse than right. In the midline, AP dimension of the thecal sac is 8 mm indicating at lease moderate-severe spinal canal stenosis. There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing at this level.

I am considering finding an alternative method for dealing with my chronic back pain - but I'm not sure if its the right move. Any advice would be helpful. 

**Backstory:**

I have had a several injuries over the years to my spine, and also to my knees which has continued to build up over the years. Over the pandemic I started seeing a chiropractor to help adjust my spine.  They planned to reverse the curve in my neck, as well as help fix some kyphosis I had as well. However, I have been going for almost a year / perhaps over a year and I am still dealing with chronic pain and sometimes, even limited mobility. I can walk and hike for short periods, which I was unable to do before. But I am still feeling frustrated and I feel like perhaps I need to find another way to start building my strength. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Chiro I see, I feel is very good. They have me do exercises at the facility, I get my adjustment, and I also have daily exercises they have prescribed. I have a positive change in my neck curve and have seen improvement. But I feel that this treatment option is quite expensive - as I have already spent quite a lot over the last year here. luckily I have had help from insurance, but I do not believe my current plan covers Chiro care.  Anyways - that being said, does anyone with a similar diagnosis have any input? Is the chronic pain supposed to exist forever? Because I don't feel like it should. I mean surely there is way to fix everything. I also have had issues with my sleep schedule, mood, and digestive issues which I believe is also tied to my spine health as well.  Some of these things have improved - and some of them have either remained the same or progressed further.

947,Chiropractic," 

Chiropractic is a healthcare profession that focuses on musculoskeletal and neurological system diseases and the consequences of these abnormalities on overall health. Chiropractors are trained to evaluate and restore joint function. Back pain, neck discomfort, arm and leg pain, and headaches are among the most common neuromusculoskeletal symptoms treated with chiropractic care.

Doctors of Chiropractic (sometimes known as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians) are healthcare providers who use a drug-free, hands-on approach which involves patient assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Chiropractors are educated and trained to diagnose patients and offer therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises along with nutritional, dietary and lifestyle advice. 

## 7 Considerations When Finding Your Chiropractor

1. **Recommendations**  
When looking for a chiropractor, the first thing to consider is who comes highly recommended. You should check for references and reviews from at least two sources. To begin, request a referral list from your doctor. This is a smart place to start because your primary care physician is familiar with your medical needs. Based on this information, they will be able to provide an informed recommendation.
2. **Coverage**  
A practical consideration is insurance. Look for chiropractors who are covered by your insurance plan to prevent paying for your chiropractic appointments out of pocket. Treatment with a chiropractor usually entails numerous visits.
3. **Do some preliminary research**  
You can begin your background research once you have your list of suggested chiropractors (and have confirmed which insurance plan is suitable). First, check to see if they have a Doctor of Chiropractic degree, which indicates they have undergone extensive training. Second, double-check that their license is current in British Columbia. You may find out their license number by simply calling their office and asking for it. 
4. **Customer feedback**  
Check out some customer reviews to see how each chiropractor you‚Äôre considering is rated. Because everyone‚Äôs experiences are different, customer reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. However, when reviewing a chiropractor, these can be useful in recognizing red flags. It‚Äôs also a red flag if you can‚Äôt find any client reviews ‚Äì you should go over your research again to see just how much experience the chiropractor has.
5. **The ability to specialize**  
Any chiropractor worth their salt should have dealt with a variety of problems. However, they are likely to have a certain specialty, and it‚Äôs worth looking into this to see if it applies to your treatment. Specializations can focus on either a certain body component or the damage type, even based on gender. To find out if a chiropractor‚Äôs speciality can help you, call their office or go to their website.
6. **Convenience**  
When it comes to choosing a chiropractor, convenience is crucial. You don‚Äôt want to go great distances to see them if you‚Äôre going to see them more than a few times. Therefore, look for chiropractors near your place of business, your child‚Äôs school, or your residence.
7. **Communication**  
When it comes to choosing a chiropractor, communication style is crucial. Because chiropractors will touch and manipulate your body, you should find someone you can converse with openly. You should also look for a chiropractor who will pay close attention and understand your issues.",What is the Definition of Chiropractic?
948,Chiropractic,"So this pain started about 3-4 months ago with a tight pulling burning pain between my shoulder blades. It‚Äôs changed multiple times been gone at times Always to return. I‚Äôve been to chiro who‚Äôs taken X-rays and done exam and said they think it‚Äôs due to a straight neck ? Whiplash syndrome possibly from old accidents(I‚Äôve had a lot) I‚Äôve also been to g p who did X-rays and said it‚Äôs arthritis. He gave me prednisone wich did help at one point and also muscle relaxers and they help a little as well. 

Overall it‚Äôs very hard to describe this pain, and I can‚Äôt trace it to an injury it just showed up ! The best way I can describe it is an odd constant tight feeling on my thoracic spine and base of my neck. It‚Äôs accompanied with little shooting pains that come and go quickly in my traps and in between my shoulder blades. There is a almost constant muscle spasm feeling like a muscle knot in the very center of my back( it has gotten a little better but still there) it‚Äôs also accompanied by a very tight feeling right where that muscle spasm feeling is right on my spine‚Ä¶ almost feels like my joint is locking up. 
There is also a lot of popping and cracking going on and I at some points feel like I have to constantly crack my upper back(therapeutic exercises have helped with that some) there are good days there are days where it‚Äôs rough, but it doesn‚Äôt keep me from doing anything. I will say that exercise helps a lot I feel great during and shortly after exercise. The pain is like it radiates from my spine.

I've been struggling with fatigue and headaches and dizziness. I went to a chiropractor for the first time with these issues and a lot of neck pain. My chiro looked at my xrays and found my atlas was misaligned and I had a subluxation in my middle back.

For example, patient has low back pain and I end up finding PART for and adjusting right SIJ, L3, T4 and C3. Even though I adjusted 4 regions, I would consider the LBP complaint as covering medical necessity for JUST the SIJ and L3, so I would bill this as a 98940.

It's been 5 months and I've noticed a big difference. Seeing her once a week now. Soon I should be down to every other week. Here's my questions.

Is stage 1 of Spinal Degeneration reversible? Or will I always be reliant on chiropractor care?

A big issue seems to be that I am missing the curve in my neck. My first chiropractor seemed to think this could be fixed by rolling a towel up under my neck for 20 minutes a day. I tried that for 2 years and the effects never lasted. Is it possible to restore the neck curve permanently?",Stage 1 - Spinal Degeneration. Is it reversible?

1006,Chiropractic,"I have been dealing with shoulder pain for years. After pursuing all other avenues besides surgery, my doctor recommended I try seeing a chiropractor. 

I went in for the first time two days ago. We sat down and discussed my pain and what my treatment plan would be. I was feeling pretty excited by what I was hearing, because it sounded like he could really help me. The chiropractor laid me down on my stomach, and started by adjusting my neck. I was SUPER taken aback -- like I said I've never had this done before and the movement was so sudden and aggressive it kind of shocked me. I was surprised it didn't break my neck lol, the cracking was LOUD. It really freaked me out. I am really sensitive and I am not the type of person who is used to cracking my back or neck or even my knuckles. It is not a sensation I enjoy.

After that he did a few more things to my back and shoulder. Then I was taken into a different room for some electrical stimulation therapy. As I was walking to the next room, I felt fine, just a bit unsettled by the neck adjustment still. I was in the new room for about five minutes, then an assistant came to set me up for the electrical stimulation. As she was setting me up, I started to get extremely lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseous. My vision and hearing started blacking out and I felt like I was about to faint (which has never ever in my life happened to before). We stopped, she got me some water, opened the windows, and I laid down for a few minutes. I think if I had stayed standing for even 30 seconds longer, I probably would've passed out. The chiropractor came in to make sure I was okay. He said that although it is rare, people sometimes have this kind of reaction to a large adjustment and he promised it would never happen to me again. TBH though...he seemed a little freaked out and taken aback by my reaction.

Now it's two days later and my neck and back feel quite sore. Not painful, but definitely a weird feeling that hasn't passed. I'm supposed to go back tonight but I am honestly feeling really nervous and kind of skeptical. I am definitely going to at least show up and discuss my concerns and how I am feeling with him, but I am afraid to let him adjust my neck again.

Should I trust him that this kind of reaction was nothing to worry about?",Almost fainted after first adjustment...should I be concerned to go back?

I had a dissectomy for a bulging disc a few years ago but this seems vastly different.

I'm in physio therapy who has me doing stretch/band around my knee exercises to activate my pelvic floor.

It's very on/off. Riding my motorcycle, my absolute #1 love and hobby, makes it pretty bad for days. Sitting can hurt or walking, but not guaranteed triggers. Bowel movements seem to affect things for sure.

In particular today I noticed that if I relax my spinchter (or whatever it is you call the muscle group that I hold my poo with) and press on the bottom of my coccyx, it causes intense sharp pain. Tighten up, and it's like it's not there. It's the same spot I rub after motorcycle rides.

1027,Chiropractic,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for advice. 

I started seeing a chiropractor in 2020 right before the pandemic due to an injury but I stopped going to that particular office after the pandemic started. I was/still am new to the chiropractic field as a patient but I compared some of the experiences I had there to posts on this sub and decided to stop going to that office. I had relief from the initial injury right away but they were engaging in really intense marketing regarding immunity and there were billing red flags I won't get into too much because that is not the point of this post - suffice to say I stopped going. 

Essentially, fast forward two years to now. I have been having more issues with my lifestyle aggravating the injury and I went to a new chiropractor last week who I have a much better vibe with. I'm actually really excited to continue going there!  

Before the appointment last week I reached out via my old chiro's website and essentially put in a ticket requesting to get a copy of my old xrays in preparation for my appointment. They never responded. So today I called directly and spoke with their receptionist moments ago. All I said is that I'm a former patient and that I'd like a copy of my xrays. She was very good natured in her response, she said that she'd be happy to get my xrays for me but they are the property of the chiropractor's office and that I could check them out any time that I'd like for 10 days at a time. To which I said, that's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. So at this time she took my phone number and said she'd call me back when I can come check out the xrays.   


I don't work in health care but for my job I am required to complete the same HIPPA training every year so I know I have a right to my data. Even my new chiro reiterated this briefly when I met him and told him that I'd reached out for my old xrays but not heard back - he indicated I should be able to get a dvd or something with them digitally. The receptionist on the phone said that she could not give me a digital copy because they were film. And apparently them being film is the same reason they own my xrays she said. I asked her what happens if I check out my xrays and never return them and she just said something like, ""well, we own them cause they're film"". If I recall correctly, I had to pay like $80 for those xrays at the time but I could be wrong. To me it feels like it's my body, my data, my film, my money my everything. I feel like I should be able to not even have copies but the originals and never return them and do whatever I want cause it's all mine. 

So my realm of questioning for you all centers around these xrays and my rights and how I should proceed. Is there a difference between having a right to my data and ""owning"" my data? Should I just ""check out"" the xrays, share them with my new chiro and then return them to the old chiro as they want? Should I check them out and then never return them because I'm petty? What can they do to me if I never return them? You all probably know what questions I should be asking better than me so any advice is appreciated.

1055,Chiropractic,"One of my favorite things to teach chiropractors is ion channels and how clinically relevant they can be. I think the lesson creates some ""a-ha"" moments for a lot of us, too. I know it did for me years ago when I learned this. Areas of injured nerves can result in the formation of AIGS (Abnormal Impulse Generating Sites) where impulses start to generate in parts of the axon that normally wouldn't generate impulses. These occur because injuries to nerve cells alters their gene expression and this causes ion channels (as well as the type of ion channel... different types respond to different stimuli) to accumulate and form in the injured area. 

Ion channels have to set up shop where there is no myelin, so this occurs in the DRG (which is already insanely sensitive), areas of thinned myelin and areas of demyelination. Injured nerves have alterations in axoplasmic flow, too, and that helps this process along. Different types of ion channels respond to different kinds of stimuli, so some AIGS may be sensitive to repetitive movements while others are sensitive to sustained positioning. Others may be sensitive to thermal changes (which I think explains why some people feel worse pain in cold weather). Emotions can set AIGS off because adrenaline and noradrenaline can open some types of ion channels.

AIGS fire impulses toward the spine and also toward the periphery. The signals that fire peripherally cause release of pro-inflammatory chemicals into their target tissues, which is called neurogenic inflammation, a type of inflammation that is generally unresponsive to medications. I think this can  also explain some of those cases where people report pain that seems to start distally and move proximally, opposite of what most of us were taught occurs in irritated nerves. 

Hopefully this gives you some better appreciation of the humble ion channel!",Did you know ion channels are actually cool?

1061,Chiropractic,"Hello all

I went to a chiro recently for headache, head pressure, neck pain, back pain, tingling on my left foot.

I went the first time and he made some adjustments with an activator and some atlas orthogonal. Then I saw him again two days later and also had a physio session, also prescribed by him, but done by a PT.

I had actually been feeling a bit better before I saw him the first time and up to the day I did. The day after the first adjustment I was very sore, and the day after that all my problems came back. Second session was yesterday and I'm feeling better but still worse than before I started. Actually, arguably he and/or the PT set me back since the food tingling is worse than when I started! 

He wants me to keep seeing him twice a week and probably do 8-10 more adjustments, all with PT attached to it. This is around 300 USD per instance... I understand some feel worse before better but after two sessions I'm actually feeling worse than when I started seeing him. He so said it would take two weeks or so (that's over a thousand dollars there, thanks) 

Does the above sound normal? If you ask me I'm worse than when I started seeing him and I'm inclined to instead go see an orthopedist, which my insurance will actually cover!

1064,Chiropractic,"I just saw a new chiropractor after moving to a new city and not being seen by another for 4 years. I have chronic lower back pain, some shoulder pain, and hip pain. I am 30 years old. 

I had x-rays and testing done and he adjusted me the first visit. Second visit he adjusted me, did e-stim, some rehab exercises. He then showed me a potential 3 month plan. 3x/week for 1 month, test, 2x/week for 1 month, test, and then 1x/week for 1 month and test. The tests seemed likely not evidence based - It was some sort of thermal (automatic nervous system) test, a spinal test, and one other. He stated that this is just an outline, we can change anything I‚Äôd like, if I feel better we can lessen my time, make changes as we go, etc. however, getting this testing done so many times seems like overkill, especially when insurance will not cover more than 1 test and only about half of these potential sessions.

From what I have been reading elsewhere, the whole 3 month plan seems sketchy. But after 2 sessions My pain has minimized greatly! He is open to my feedback and wants, seems focused on long-term changes and functional changes like posture/sleep, etc. has great reviews too.

1072,Chiropractic,"Hello.

I'm a new patient who has been receiving chiropractic care for hip pain (two appointments so far spaced two weeks apart). I saw my chiropractor two weekends ago, and then again this past weekend. My chiropractor diagnosed me with hip impingement, and said that my hip flexors are extremely tight, and she wants to loosen them up first and foremost before she can give me physio exercises.

During both appointments, my chiropractor did a painful massage of my hip flexor/groin area, where she put her fingers in the hip joint area, and had me straighten and bend my leg.

She also advised that I try to heat my groin and hip area as often as possible with heating pads or hot baths. I am also supposed to not bend my hip at more than a 90 degree angle.

After my first appointment with her two weekends ago, my hip flexors were in more pain than I was in before I saw her, which subsided after a few days.

After my appointment with her three days ago, my hips flexors/groin area has been in more pain than they have ever been before and the pain does not seem to be subsiding. I have tried to stretch them, but even with the most gentle hip flexor stretches the pain seems to be aggravated even more. I'm very concerned about the amount of pain my hips flexors/groin is in.

Right now I feel there is nothing I can do to stretch or help with the hip pain. I have tried all the heating and hot baths, and have not been sitting at all (only laying down horizontally or standing at my desk), and have not done any of my usual exercises for fear of aggravating the pain more with bending or stretching. (I have only been doing some bridges which I do every morning and evening anyway).

My questions are: Is it possible my chiro hurt my hip flexor muscles or did something to bruise them or make the pain worse? Should I keep up with the hot baths and pads or is it possible that the heat is making the pain worse? Should I try to stretch my hip flexors through the pain or should I only rest them? Should I cancel my appointment with the chiro and seek a different practitioner? Help!

(Note: I have already contacted my doctor to request a referral to a sports doctor and imaging on my hips to confirm the impingement. Given the amount of pain I'm in, I am pursuing medical assistance, however, I am not sure how long the waitlist with the sports doctor is going to be, and in the meantime I am not sure if I should continue working with this particular chiropractor)",Patient question: Lots of pain after Chiropractor appointment.

6 year in practice chiro (diversified, art, sports  practitioner) I've started working at a very high end, high price point clinic, multi-disciplinary clinic.  I've been met with many skeptical and (relatively) difficult patients on my caseload, many of these patients are new to chiropractic.  Patients are presenting with such daily requests and expectations:

  
\- expectations range from 'fix me' in one to two sessions (think acute on chronic presentations ie spinal stenosis, cervical radiculopathy, labral tears, facet irritation):  
\-wanting a massage, physiotherapy, and chiropractic approach all in one  
\-requesting orthopedic exam write outs  
\-requesting write-ups and letters to their MD often  
\-wanting me to call their physios and MD's to ""okay"" chiropractic treatment   
\-want multiple imaging reports read on the spot  
\-wanting full sports training and rehabilitation programs designed and executed and integrated into treatment (ie ACL rehab)  
\-asking repeatedly for me to 'go check' with other practitioners to make treatment plans congruent   
\-asking me to change my technique to match their retired chiropractor's style and delivering perfect full spine adjustments every time (I try!)    


The list goes on.  I'm getting exhausted and burn out very quickly.  Patient retention and compliance is at its lowest in my career.   I love working with patients, I love explaining why their problems are re-occurring, I explain how to move better, which active exercises to do,  and how assist my chiro care at home. I set realistic expectations with patients.   I spend 45 min on initials and do a very thorough exam, 20min follow ups.  I treat dependent upon patients needs and only do maintenance care if  needed, but it is encouraged.

1100,Chiropractic,"I‚Äôm pretty frustrated and I‚Äôm trying to get some clarity on an issue.

I have a Medicare patient from New Jersey (I am not in NJ) who has Horizon Blue/BCBS of New Jersey as her supplemental insurance. After submitting claims, Horizon sends me payment in the form of a virtual credit card. These credit cards are a scam. They want you to manually enter the credit card and amount on your point of sale terminal. This type of transaction has very high processing fees, up to 5%. The credit card issuer also kicks make a portion of this processing fee back to the payer.

The Affordable Care Act addresses this issue and requires payers to make EFT payments if the provider refuses the virtual card.

However, so far it seems like the EFT enrollment process for Horizon seems to be a sham. Even though they claim they offer this, there is no actual way to enroll. Every time you call they give you a different set of instructions for enrolling. First, they claim you must enroll as a participating provider. While I am in network in BCBS, I am not a provider for a regional plan in another part of the country. You are not required to enroll as a provider for supplemental insurance. Second, even after completing their lengthy list of documents required (Tax ID, NPI, address, statement on office letter head with your intent to join the network, subscribe to NaviNet, W-2 form, and more) they claim to wait 30 days for approval. I finished these tasks in October, then again in December after being told they have none of my information in their system.

1101,Chiropractic,"Hello all, 

I got whiplash at the beginning of the year and decided to go see a chiropractor. I did go see my primary physician and she diagnosed me with whiplash and recommended PT as well. I went to see a chiropractor because I've had success before - I had a concussion a few years ago and a chiropractor helped me get mobile again (less neck pain and headaches.) 

So, the first few chiropractic appointments were uneventful. He didn't really do manipulations as he wanted the neck inflammation to go down before he attempted anything. He did review what symptoms I had and what plan of action he would do. 

I did receive sports massages and waited on PT. I eventually made it to my 9th appt (which would be the third appt where he would try some manipulations as he done very gentle ones before.) I also told him that my back pain was getting worse and he suggested to try to help there too. 

The neck adjustment was harsher than the one before, and he quickly moved my head to the left and then to the right. I felt a pop but didn't really feel any pain. I do admit I was tense when he did the adjustment as I wasn't prepared for the kind of force used. Then he had me lie on my back and cracked my back on both sides by placing one leg over the other one and pressing down. 

This seemed to help my back pain and I was fine leaving. On the way home, I noticed my neck felt strained (similar to when I had whiplash symptoms appear) and took some ibuprofen. I went to see him back the next day as the pain had gotten worse. He tried adjusting my neck again but didn't really do anything that caused popping. 

Now, it's been 3 days since the original adjustment. I have burning back pain and my neck pain has gotten better but I am still sore and in pain. I did go see my primary care physician and she thinks he may have aggravated my muscles which also aggravated my nerves, leading to the pain I've been having.  I don't have any dizziness but did notice nausea two days after the original adjustment. 

Honestly, I never want to go back to the chiropractor. He does have great reviews and I know a few people who have gone to him and rave about him. Honestly, I don't know what to do now. I keep hearing the horror stories of strokes weeks after an adjustment and I'm really worried this might happen to me.

1103,Chiropractic,"Hi, I‚Äôm [24F] and have just recently went to the chiropractor and now I might have back surgery. 

This started at the beginning of the year, I got Covid and, well, had a really tough time with it. I also kept the nasty cough after getting over Covid. About a day or two after getting over the sickness my back started to hurt really bad. It felt like standing up I needed to almost pop back into place before being able to walk. I finally found a Chiropractor and went to him. The pain extended from the bottom of my spine to my hip. He fixed my hip issue but didn‚Äôt touch my spine. I was still  in some pain and when I told him about the spine part he told me that it was a mental thing and I would start to feel better by next week. I don‚Äôt know about bones like he does so I took his word for it and by the time next week came and I was still in pain I tried to make another appointment but he was gone on vacation. All while going through this I was starting my new job as a barista. Sort of labor intensive at the shop I work at so I figured I needed to get my back fixed before it got worse so I found a walk-in chiropractor that had 4.8 stars. 

Looking back now I really regret going. 

I went and told them the issue was in my spine and they seemed to fix it, or so I thought. Later that same day my hip started to hurt again but more than last time, my back pain was subsided though. I went back a few more times and every visit it worsened. Eventually I left there with a leg that was numb from my knee down and a hip that was excruciatingly painful to walk on. (Side note, he used a massager on my hip and leg and actually left bruising from how hard he pushed.) I decided I needed to see a different kind of Chiropractor, one that was more gentle and did just that. By this time I was in so much pain that I was crying to walk and standing for a longer time than 5 minutes made me dizzy. When I went to the other chiropractor he told me that he wouldn‚Äôt adjust me at the time because my back and leg muscles were so inflamed that he couldn‚Äôt tell what my issue was but he was afraid it was a disc injury. He told me that if my numbness gets any worse to go to the ER. That weekend, Super Bowl Sunday actually, I ended up taking an ER trip because I couldn‚Äôt move my toes and any sort of pressure on my leg was unbearable. They did a few tests and found out that I have 4 herniated discs in my back that are pinching off my Sciatica nerve which is causing the numbness. I now am on steroids and will have to get more injected into my back and if that doesn‚Äôt work then I have no other choice but to undergo back surgery. I‚Äôve had other bad experiences with past chiropractors and so I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it truly was until the ER visit. I don‚Äôt want to assume that that Chiropractor is the reason for the herniated discs because I originally went for my back and hip but it wasn‚Äôt nearly this bad until after him.

I've been having upper back pain and slight neck pain since April 2021, my upper back (C7, T1, T2) started cracking whenever I'd straighten my back while sitting at the desk. Things went up and down, and in December 2021 I've decided to try chiropractic because I started having more pain near my cervical area.

I have a pretty straight spine (not really military neck). Before the adjustment I remember also having a migraine after showering with cold water.

Anyway, I went to the chiropractor before Christmas (here in Romania), I'm not sure if the guy was 100% certified, but he's seen lots of people, so I assumed he was ok. During the adjustment he did 3 types of neck adjustments:

\- while I was on my back, cracked my neck twice on each side.

\- while on my belly, chin on table, cracked my neck twice on each side

\- pulled my feet while my head was down in the whole of the table

Long story short, I've had neck pain and upper back pain more than before after this adjustment for almost a month or so. Even episodes of headaches with the neck pain.

Now my neck cracks, pops, grinds, all day long is certain positions and I can hear it in my ears... I'm not sure I had those before, but I'm driving myself nuts. I keep hearing those cracks without intentionally wanting to crack my neck, like something's snapping or grinding over there (bone to bone?).

1132,Chiropractic,"I had an odd experience and was wondering if it is typical. I went to a chiropractor for the first time and was charged $100 for the office visit (my copay was $25) and that is what I was expecting. But then I get a separate bill for $135 for the actual adjustment/treatment during the session. I had even specifically asked when I was there about costs and was just told about my copay and that since the assistant wasn't in that they would send me the bill. Is this typical? The equivalent of $235 seemed a bit high for an adjustment, but even more so, the actual billing processes seemed very misleading. 

I have never been to one before, so I thought maybe it was par for the course, but it seemed so different than the billing I was used to as a mental health provider. 

(the chiropractor also made a comment about my Tourettes asking if I did anything ""funny"" that I didn't appreciate, but that is beside the point)",Question about typical billing

1136,Chiropractic,"Hi all....I'm not a chiropractor, but have learned to crack just about everything on myself but see a chiro for my SI joint.

My now middle aged dog runs a \*LOT\* and while I'm sure regular adjustments would be beneficial, even adjustments for myself are not really in my budget right now.

I am however interested in buying an activator tool and using it on my dog. He is a mixed breed, just under 20 pounds. I've seen some training videos on YouTube, and it seems like such a tool could theoretically only help and isn't potentially dangerous?  Any training or usage tips?

Aside from the basic activator device, I've also seen larger ones that are powered by electricity and has larger horseshaped prongs, and others? What is best? Seems like the activator device is for the standard sequence, and the horseshoe prong device is to get heavy/deep just along the spine?

1145,Chiropractic,"I've mostly been oriented toward mainstream medicine, but recently decided to try a chiropractor to help with some lingering shoulder pain after holding my shoulder in an odd position for some time at work. I was expecting that the chiropractor would manipulate my arm and shoulder, and that would have some similar benefits to massage or physical therapy, even if it reached them via somewhat different means. Instead, he said he used this Torque Release Technique that was more effective than manual adjustment. He clicked an ""integrator"" on my shoulder and neck for like 5 minutes and said I'd need to come back twice a week for 6 months, but that he could set me up on a payment plan. I felt no benefits.

I‚Äôm Dr. Rebecca Lee and I am a Chiropractor practicing in Maryland in a cash-based clinic with a focus on neck and low back herniations and overall wellness.

1147,Chiropractic,"I recently drove to another state and saw a functional medicine doctor that offered to do a CBP chiro analysis and X-rays on me. It revealed that my spine is basically straight with little curve and my neck is actually curved backwards. I‚Äôve been in a lot of pain my entire life so this made some sense despite seeing my old chiropractor who I really like for years.

Since he was in another state he referred me to a different CBP chiro where I live. This chiro would not accept my x-rays I just took a week ago and I had to pay for them again. She showed me everything the other chiropractor showed me and then hit me with an enormous payment plan over $3000 for 36 visits by the second visit. This chiropractor knows I am living off workers comp for an unrelated torn ligament in my foot. Yet she offered me multiple plans that were cheaper the more you pay upfront.

1155,Chiropractic,"""An interesting dichotomy I am noticing amongst EB Chiros. 

As associates, the compensation is a big factor, concern, and conversation, as it should be. 

But when they become a practice owner they don't want to talk about money and profits. They want to only ""serve"" the patient. Afraid to admit they want to be handsomely profitable too. 

Oftentimes, assuming those who are ""killing it"" must be doing something shady or providing worse care than you.  

Being a great patient-centered doctor and wanting to be compensated very well for it isn't mutually exclusive. 

What are you doing to provide great care, patient experience, healthy revenue, and a great profit margin? The math can add up. But it will take vision, strategy, conviction, and consistency.

1159,Chiropractic,"After visiting the orthopedic doc (was assisted by a PA never saw the doc) for a pinched never in my lower left back, the X-rays showed that I have mild scoliosis. I asked the PA and she brushed it off saying it‚Äôs no big deal and wouldn‚Äôt cause any long term consequences. 

I wasn‚Äôt a fan of that answer and I started looking into potential treatment. I booked a consultation with a chiropractor and this guy had a ‚Äúholistic wellness‚Äù type approach to the consultation - asking about my goals, how the back situation is making me feel emotionally and the day to day impact.

1161,Chiropractic,"I was asked my advice on reaching out to local businesses, and decided to share with everyone! This is particularly good for students or new docs, or if you are just trying to brainstorm some new thoughts.

The size of your practice will be relative to the number of people you know, so when reaching out to other businesses you want to reach as many people as you can. Everybody has a spine, they have employees with spines, and so on. Never prejudge a place!

I made little networking groups. You can join groups like BNIs and RLIs, and by all means do so, but also do this. Get local business owners together for coffee for about 20 minutes. Keep the meeting short and focused, go around and have everyone share what they do and how others can help them. Everyone can exchange cards. I would collect emails and ask if people would like to meet up again in a month or few weeks? I'd email everyone the next date. I also would ask them to invite someone else they think could benefit. 

At one time I had 4 or 5 of these groups going on at the same time. I had mornings, lunches, after work cocktails multiple days a month. Having multiple times makes it easier to invite people. If someone can't make it over lunch, maybe they would be able to do in the morning? Tuesday doesn't work, how about Thursday? (more pots catch more fish). If you are nervous about it, just start with one group.

Here is how I would invite people:

""Hi, I'm Dr K and I was getting some local business owners together to learn about each others' businesses and help each other grow. Would you like to join us?""

Have an idea what you want to say, but don't be scripted with it. If someone says no, that is fine. At the least you put out energy that you were trying to help others, and they'll remember that. I even had a few people ask to come in as patients right then. Some of the groups I had up to 16 people at a time, but others maybe only were 4-6. Even if it is just 1 person showing up, you can still make a connection and relationship. I always started by calling insurance agents, realtors, bankers, photographers. These are people who go to just about every networking thing they can. You can make a choice to include MLM folks, that's up to you. But by calling these professions you generally always guarantee you'll have at least a handful show up.

I would call over and over. The first call is always nervous, but you get into a groove. I would make a goal that I would make 20 calls in a day, or maybe I would go until I get 20 ""no""s. If you have big anxiety on the phone, reward yourself afterwards with Taco Bell for facing your fears.

Another way to reach out to businesses is simply to walk in. I did this in multiple ways, but the best way is to bring something with you. You can get candy, fruit, granola bars, donuts, or whatever you want and bring them in with your card and info. You can even phrase it as neighbor appreciation if you'd like. People are more receptive if you have food, and are willing to hear your 20 second pitch. I try not to take up much of their time unless they start asking questions and are excited. (great time to have your planner with you if someone wants to schedule while you are there). Be friendly and professional--this is their first impression of you as a new patient, just like they walked into your office. If you wanted to provide a new patient special or offer, that is up to you. I did at times and it did bring some people in.

I would also call specific businesses to build a relationship. This would be professions like LMTs or personal trainers, podorthists--people I can refer well with. I invite them to lunch and learn about them, and then work to build a relationship. Doulas are another great one if you want to work with pregnancy, kids, or reach nurses. Also hair stylists. Get as many hair stylists to know about you as possible. You get great results with headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, and wrist issues. Either way, go into these lunches looking to build a relationship. If the mindset is to get new patients, you'll fail. Be interested in the other person, and follow-up after. Not every connection will be a winner, but you'll find people you click with.

Existing patients can also be a resource. This gets into things like lunch n learns or wellness events, but if you can get in contact with an HR person they are a great entryway to helping a company. Some companies have a morale committee or wellness committee. Tell existing patients ""Thank you for letting me take care of you. I bet you have others at your office dealing with the same thing. Do you know who would be a good person to talk to for me to see what I can do to help?"" HR people love when you get prevent sick days, injuries, and improve happiness. A worker who feels good is more efficient.

These are the ways I built relationships with local businesses starting out. Really if you go outside your door and look around, everyone in a 5 mile radius should know about you. It takes a lot of energy, but it pays off. I slept best on days when I went out and gave it everything I had, rather than days where I was lazy and let the fear of being out there win. These are some of the ventures I took to get known. Say yes to all the opportunities you can when starting out!",How I Marketed to Local Businesses

1164,Chiropractic,"There's a lot to cover here... but I'm gonna try to make this short, to the point, and unbias as much as possible. 

A few weeks ago my mom referred me to this family owned Chiropractor Center in the Bay Area. She told me she heard about it from a friend. I decided to want to check it out because I literally have been telling myself I need to go to one. She said they offer x-rays and I haven't had that from my previous chiropractor many years ago, so I was interested to get an actual visual of my neck spine and hips.

The first day I came in, I was the only one wearing a mask. There were about 5 others there sitting on chairs without one. Apparently wearing a mask is optional, which i can somewhat respect to the extent of personal choice. But my mom didn't mention that to me (shes antivax and super Christian), and the doctors NEVER wore theirs (so are they). After being kinda surprised about that I just said nothing, kept my mask on and moved on. 

I filled out forms of symptoms and past medical history etc. The forms took me a little longer than it should've but before I finished, they started a class presentation about the importance of our health, what we eat and how subluxation doesn't allow the body to work at 100% function. Their definition of health is the body working at 100% function. 

Some of the things they taught were that 5/6 people in the US will possibly die of heart attack or cancer, and that the main cause of them is inflammation. What causes inflammation? Sugar. They also talked about the importance of mindful eating and making sure to look at the ingredients of what you buy etc. They even have ""Shop with the Doc"" days where we go with them to whole foods and learn what to look for when shopping.

I believe I learned something new from their presentation. It was very interesting and I agreed to a lot... but then they started playing clips on Fox News and making claims that COVID is a hoax. In this clip they basically talked about how COVID was created in a lab and used as a bioweapon to create fear tactics.

Now while that theory could be a possibility, I'm only going to take that information with a grain of salt just like any other info. Because we're talking about the unknown here. Nobody knows anything 100%. I was skeptical of the vaccine at first but I got it because I live with my grandparents who wanted me to get it. I haven't had any known issues since and never got a positive covid test. Not saying that the vaccine was the #1 reason for that, but who knows. 

Keep in mind that this family owned business is also Christian-based, and my mom is also Christian. I consider myself atheist and passively disagree with her on many things, including covid. COVID doesn't have to be political but unfortunately it is. Anyways, the presentation ends and I go home feeling all weirded out by this somewhat cult like structure.

And then comes the 2nd visit to get xrays done.

3rd visit: Before seeing my results they had another class on how to view my xrays and what to look for. After that I see how bad of shape I am and they explain everything to me. From there, they wanted to see if I wanted to continue with them and to either A.) pay up front with at 10% discount along with a ""referral discount"" and another ""25% family discount"" or B.) to open a credit account through them. And even though I was skeptical I decided to continue with them and pay the up front option with my credit card. This service costed about $2400 for 12 weeks, 3 visits a week. Is that a good price?

The next few visits went pretty well, other than the doctors not wearing masks. They also consistently tell me to take off my mask when i lay down to get an adjustment so that ""i can breathe"". I tell them politely I'll keep it on and don't mind. But other then that The visits and adjustments seemed to be doing at least something to my mood because i do feel a little better. Possibly placebo effect? 

Fast forward to this last Monday. We had a ""Shop with the Docs"" day where we met at Whole Foods and got hands on view of how to read the ingredients and what is the best choices. I show up there and most of the group had masks on except my mom, her friend, and the Doctors....

You guys... they had their masks off the entire time. We were getting eyeballs left and right and eventually they were confronted by a customer. The lady asked the Doctors if they could put their masks on and they responded with ""We're a private group."" The lady said she was disgusted by them and walked away. Then the doctors got bitter and whispered to us that they weren't even standing 6 feet from her and belittling her. 

Absolutely ridiculous. That act right there kinda showed me what kind of people these doctors are: entitled as hell. Preaching to us in a cult like fashion how health is important but don't have any consideration for others... it's literally just a mask. What kind of point are they trying to prove by not wearing one? That their way of thinking is the correct way. This just my initial feeling and I still feel this way.

I had another visit today and the docs still mention to take off the mask when i lay down.. and that in the last 2 years of doing what they do they've only had 2 patients have symptoms. And that masks don't work... if they don't work then why were surgeons wearing them before the pandemic? 

I'm not really sure what to do. I have a hard time saying no to people, so I'm still going to them because my mom referred me and also the fact that I do feel good after. But even though I feel good, I become anxious to go home and be around my grandparents. I haven't told them that this place doesn't wear masks either because then it would really upset them so i just stay locked in my room.

If I decide to opt out ""I will have to pay a $200 nonrefundable fee and will not be charged for future visits and if prepaid a refund will be issued and processed within 6 weeks.""

Part of me tells me to run towards fear and stay with them and see how things go but I'm not sure if this the right context for it...

What are your thoughts? Should I stay or are there much better options out there?",Been feeling kinda skeptical of this chiropractor center... They claim that COVID is a hoax?

I have a 40-year-old male complaining of difficulty focusing, minor neck pain, has had 2 episodes where his legs went stiff for a couple of hours, also history of numbness where the C5 &amp; 6 dermatomes are(which went off). Onset was approximately 7 years ago, initially saw a neurologist that ordered a brain MRI that revealed nothing, sent him on his way out with xanax which did nothing to help. A year later, he went to a community clinic where the attending physician attributed his symptoms to hypertension, he was given Amlodipine which made him feel faint and well.. hypotensive (BP was high during initial exam, but was normal after the first visit. I'm attributing the high BP due to pain and health related anxiety). A year after, he saw another doc at the same clinic and told him he had fibromyalgia and it was fibro fog but nothing was done (No tender spots anywhere near the neck surprisingly).

1213,Chiropractic,"So within the last 5-6 visits seeing my chiropractor, I've been noticing he reaches under my shirt and brings his hand wayyy up my back while doing certain adjustments, and it makes me really uncomfortable. He's never done this before while doing these specific adjustments, so I don't know why he would suddenly start now and why he'd do it without warning me first.

The first time it happened, I was kinda shocked and didn't say anything. When it happened again at my next visit, I said ""Can you do that OVER my shirt?"" and he did, and then he started making small talk as if nothing had just happened. 

In the following two visits nothing weird happened, and I thought that it was over with, but today I went back in and he did it AGAIN, except he only did it on one side, then didn't on the other side (he was doing a lumbar spine manipulation and I was lying on one side, then I would flip over and he would do the other side). He again did it without warning, and he acted like nothing had happened. 

So I find myself psychoanalyzing the situation and combing through the finer details to figure out if these are innocuous mistakes, or intentional, and I'm just really tired of it all.

To me it reads like he's pushing my boundaries to see what he can get away with, and feels comfortable he can do it now only after I've been under his care for so long. 

There's also a physical therapist in the same office who I see regularly, so I'm considering just cancelling my appointments with him in the future and only seeing her.

3. Tension headaches that jump around randomly, sometimes like a vice at my temples, sometimes like a band around my head, sometimes mimicking the symptoms of sinusitis.
4. A constant feeling of mild drunkenness/lightheadedness. This is somewhat difficult to explain, but it is the feeling you get when you just start drinking and the buzz kicks in. Everything just feels ""off"", if that makes sense. The worse this symptom gets, the more difficult it becomes to concentrate on high-level mental tasks.

My parents encouraged me to visit our family chiropractor. He was convinced that my spine and back muscles were misaligned which was suppressing a nerve. 

He did his thing on my back and encouraged me to come back twice a week for 2-3 weeks to see where we were at. 

Let me tell you, the positive effects of the first adjustment were felt almost immediately. I got home and noticed that my right leg ‚Äúfelt longer‚Äù. I was evenly distributing weight on both sides again. I also experienced a rush of blood to my extremities as proper blood flow returned. My toes were beet red and warm after having been ice cold for a week. 

To provide a little context - I had dislocated my right patella back in the Fall. I was in a knee brace for a while and did 6 weeks of PT which in hindsight probably wasn‚Äôt enough. So I‚Äôd been compensating ever since. 

This in combination with sitting around while working from home / playing video games a lot due to the cold weather and Covid were also big factors in misalignment I‚Äôm sure.

1225,Chiropractic,"Hi all - I'm here for advice as a patient/newcomer to chiro. I hope this post isn't redundant, but I checked the FAQs pinned post and didn't get all the answers I needed. I also did some searches, but Reddit's search function is spotty at best.  At any rate, apologies if I'm being a broken record.

I am trying to find an evidence-based chiropractor for my posture-induced neck and lower back pain and have no idea where to start. I'm on a student insurance plan, which limits my options somewhat. I'm considering chiro as an option, since it's more hands-on than PT regarding manipulation, and I believe I need that for immediate pain relief. However, it's also important to me that whatever treatment plan I'm on provides me tools for addressing the problem and improving it myself: since my pain seems to be extremely connected to my posture, that would mean learning tools for improving my posture at home so I can hopefully have a more healthy body going forward, especially since my career path requires lengthy hours in libraries and at the desk doing research and writing.

Are there any questions I should ask or red flags I should be looking out for while looking for a chiropractor?  I don't mind a holistic approach - I have studied cultures with a strong tradition of holistic medicine and I am not as much of a skeptic as some redditors with regards to whole-body medicine as a result. However, I also live in a very hippy-dippy area of the country where there's a lot of quackery practiced, so I'm trying to avoid the practitioners who believe chiro is a cure-all, or are anti-vax, etc.  I'm also trying to avoid getting stuck in a cycle where I need to keep going back for adjustments over and over again. 

There is only one chiropractor in my metropolitan area who is on the list of ""forward-thinking chiropractors"" linked in the sticky, and that office is far from my home and workplace. However, I live in a huge metropolitan area, so I imagine that there must be other EB chiropractors around here who are simply not listed on the registry.

The study is an online questionnaire to measure how important you think self-management of pain is and how confident you are in doing so, followed by a questionnaire asking how you have felt in the last two weeks.  It will take about 15-20 minutes to finish the study. 
Please feel free to contact meeting for any questions, Thank you!

1229,Chiropractic,"I've made it no secret that I am on the vitalistic side of things. One criticism that I see a lot is vitalistic docs believe in bone out of place. The thing is, I hang out with a lot of like-minded docs (across the country, seminars and get togethers that are 300+ in attendance) and not one talks or thinks in terms of bone out of place. We discuss joints that are under stress or restricted, but not that it is ""out of place"".

Is the criticism simply just based on here-say or a bias from limited interactions? Is continuing the criticism valid, or is it similar to how the medical establishment criticizes chiropractors for stroke?

I can see old docs at the start of chiropractic using bone out of place. Back then you feel a tight muscle bundle, adjust it, and it goes away. It would certainly seem like a bone was out of place. There are even Green book stories about railroad tracks being off center and needing to be tapped back in line. Of course, now we have X-ray readily and know that the bone isn't out of place. In the modern era I am sure there are some docs that communicate to a patient the bone is out of place, but in my opinion it is moreso because it is easier to explain and the doc doesn't *actually* think that.

My question then is how widespread is someone thinking ""bone out of place""? Is it a warranted criticism, or is the prevalence really just a handful at best?","How prevalent really is ""bone out of place"" thinking?"

A year or so later my back pain get worse than it has been so I went to the closest chiropractic clinic. 

After my first adjustment the back was very soar which is normal. I ended up going back 2 weeks later and it felt good. However, each time I would go the pain got wise to the point my trip to Vegas, the pain got so bad that I thought it would ruin the trip. 

I got back home and the pain worsened each day until it reached the point of excruciating like back in 2019.

1241,Chiropractic,"I went to the chiropractor today because my neck has been bugging me due to a whiplash injury from being rear ended. Long story short - he did a full body diagnostic, and white he did pinpoint the pain in my neck, back, and should, he also found that my left knee had an ‚Äúangry tibia post‚Äù. What he did was have me lay on my stomach, and bend my knees sort of back towards my bum. He noticed the left wasn‚Äôt bending as far - and he sort of, I guess pressed and felt deep in the back of my knees. My right one felt normal but my left felt extreme pain. He called this a ‚Äúvery angry tibia post‚Äù (which makes sense, my knee cap had been bothering me a few days prior to this but I thought nothing of it. He said he can help me fix this. But he didn‚Äôt crack or adjust it (unless that‚Äôs what all the pressing and prodding was?)

My knee was fine going in - it felt okay going out - and so I went home and ran some errands and did about two hours of walking. Now I‚Äôm stuck onto my couch - it‚Äôs very sore, sharp pain if I bend or flex the wrong way. It hurts on the backside and side alot. I‚Äôve been icing it. 

Here‚Äôs what I wanna know: did he do an adjustment on me knee, and is this normal? Because there was no cracking or popping like he did to my back, neck, and shoulder. It was sort of like he just dug around deep in the back of my left knee. Is this what the adjustment is, or did he not do it yet and just somehow irritate the part i pain and cause inflammation?

1268,Chiropractic,"Hey docs, graduated 6 months ago and am now working in an upper cervical office. We do activator as well. When I initially interviewed the position as an associate the offer was 60k-100k a year with retirement matching (3%). The  work hours were 3 full days (8 hours) and 2 half days (4 hours). My training/on-boarding was suppose to be 9am-6pm 5 days a week to get me upto speed. Once I hit ""fully"" trained I was suppose to get two half days. Well I got up to speed about 3 months in and yet I've only received 1 half day shift.

 On top of that, my bonus pay is based on collections...I charged 42k my 4th month and yet we are only collecting 50% of that. 5th month in I charged 47k and still...50%. I'm in month 6 and am now seeing 50+ patients a day, charged 55k and now collections is 33% (I run my numbers every week). So at this point I'm busting my butt, but we aren't collecting enough for me to hit bonus pay (I have 5 tiers when I hit certain thresholds). And I still haven't received my 2nd half day. On top of that, I'm training another doc that was hired into the office. At what point do I ask for #1, my 2nd half day and #2, why are the collection rates for me, so low? Because at this point my base pay is 48k before taxes and I'm barely making enough to pay rent and take care of my family. The only reason we are still afloat is because student loans got pushed till may.

Also, I have asked for both my half days and yet the main doc has said they don't have answer or date on when I'll get them. I also don't get paid to train the other doc and I have been staying an hour after work helping them which puts stress on me and family time since I'm gone from sun-up to sun down most days out of the week.

That was a lot but I don't really have a place or anyone to talk to about this because only chiropractors would understand my situation. Could really use some advice.

1275,Chiropractic,"No. And I wish like anything y‚Äôall would STOP saying you do PT/are just like a PT. Or telling EB chiros they are PT/MD wannabe‚Äôs

Yea, I know the national board says PT and many states use the term. But that doesn‚Äôt make you a PT and you aren‚Äôt doing PT. 

You are a chiropractor. Be proud of that and stop wasting energy trying to define yourself to people as ‚Äúkind of like a PT.‚Äù  Start defining the profession accurately. 

BJ Palmer did it with his exercise facility. Why can‚Äôt you?

It‚Äôs not PT, it‚Äôs exercise rehab, exercise prescription, modalities, ergonomic assessment. Physical therapists don‚Äôt have exclusive rights to that stuff. Any more than MD‚Äôs own blood pressure cuffs. 

They are an essential part of getting sick and injured people well and maintaining health for the coming years. 

I know, and have had the quarrel here ‚Äúthe adjustment defines chiro, everything else is not chiro.‚Äù 

This from the same guy who, ages ago on this sub, said he used to try to practice EB but it was so much effort and now that he is subluxation based, his life is so much easier and less stressful. 

Yea‚Ä¶no. In the immortal words of my old uncle‚Ä¶‚Äùdon‚Äôt be a lazy dog.Do the work.‚Äù

Look, all of the modalities, the exercise, the tests and evaluation are in our scope. They are in our history. People fought hard for their inclusion in our laws. Don‚Äôt cheapen the profession by claiming to be something else. Add value to your own profession and make the effort to more accurately define yourself, your abilities, your skill and knowledge in the minds of the public. 

I can tell you right now PA‚Äôs will never claim to be a nurse practitioner and vice versa.  They are both mid level providers, with much in common. But def not the same. 

A DO I know says ‚ÄúMy education overlaps with an MD‚Äôs, and I did the same residency, but the core is different.‚Äù

I see it on websites, signs and advertising all the time ‚Äúwe do physical therapy.‚Äù 

Why oh why?  Chiropractic is a profession. Not a skill set. Try ‚Äúour expertise and experience in evaluation, manual treatment, exercise rehab and modalities gets you well and keeps you well.‚Äù

So, what sets us apart? 

History certainly does. Our background of having the title ‚ÄúDr‚Äù isn‚Äôt a small thing. Sure, our history is full of DC‚Äôs who shirk their responsibilities and do just one thing. But when you look again you see DC‚Äôs who have  taken the term ‚Äúchiropractic physician‚Äù very seriously. Study the people who built National, Lincoln and the other early ‚Äúscience based‚Äù schools. Study the men and women who ran BJ out of his own organization. Study the men and women, like Logan‚Äôs past president Bee Hagan, who went to jail for taking blood pressures.  

We have had a Dr mind set from the beginning. That other group has not. 

Diagnosis and referral sets us apart. Imaging certainly does. Not to mention the chiro specialties like neuro, ortho, internal med. 

I took a neuro CEU course with Dr Antonucci down in Miami, Fl. Holy moly, learn all you can. 

I think we need to start defining ourselves as patient centered. And we need to highlight that we use judgement and discretion. Not that we are one-trick ponies but that we evaluate and use exceptional judgement on how to manage each case. And our results speak for themselves

Selling ourselves as one trick ponies is selling ourselves way short. And ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a one trick pony who also does someone else‚Äôs job on the side,‚Äù is even worse. 

I agree with my colleague I mentioned before, it is the adjustment that sets us apart. It is starting at the joint level, the macro, that often makes us more effective. 

Chiropractic adjustment is an incredibly powerful and irreplaceable tool. And is is ours to maintain and nurture through research. 

But defining chiropractic as only adjusters isn‚Äôt accurate, any more than a hammer or saw defines a carpenter.  Carpenters build things. And we trust them to use the right tool at their discretion. 

Chiropractors get sick and injured people well and help them stay healthy. Trust us to use our skills, judgement and discretion. 

Chiropractors have demonstrated the power of starting care at the articular level.  Good Chiropractors also use all the available tools, at their discretion, to help patients get healthy and stay healthy. 

Most importantly of all, Do NOT be so ashamed of our great profession that you claim to be something else. Be proud of who and what you are. 

Words are important. Use yours carefully. Define yourself accurately. Don‚Äôt steal someone else‚Äôs thunder.

1284,Chiropractic,"I am having a discussion with an individual to discuss the role of EB chiros and I don‚Äôt have a clear rebuttal to the answer of why chiros exist in the first place.

The argument of this individual is that chiropractors specialize in a minority subset of lower back pain and are indistinguishable from PTs when using an EB approach. The entire profession originates from pseudoscience and it is only recently that they decided to follow an EB approach.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt chiropractors just admit their profession has zero validity and tell the public that their future practices mirror what physios do?‚Äù

Although there are PTs that don‚Äôt focus on EBP, that is a minority of what is a majority-EB profession, whereas chiropractors are the opposite. Only a minor group that claim EB while the majority of the profession are charlatans since it stems from one guy motivated by a ghost. That‚Äôs why the good and bad apples argument is not relevant in this context.

Furthermore, the individual explains that there is no double blinded study showing the efficacy of chiropractors, rendering them useless to mild low back pain, which resolves itself within two weeks the majority of the time. The only reason a patient would ever go see a chiropractor is when they are desperate and that is when chiropractors utilize tactics for patient retention, essentially taking advantage of the disabled to treat problems that resolve on its own without intervention. (Insinuating the fact that temporary relief of cracking bones creates a placebo ultimately promoting repeat and unnecessary visits.

The individual then argues that ‚Äúif you go see someone and it works, then stick to it‚Äù idea is imprudent because anecdotes have no high quality evidence behind them. Anyone can make up why x works though it may seem egregious, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs useful in a clinical setting. The same goes for chiropractors and the relief that patients get from seeing them.

I will admit, there‚Äôs quite of ignorance to these arguments, and I do not have the perspective of a licensed EB chiropractor or extensive research on the efficacy of HVLA-SMT to answer these points.

1296,Chiropractic,"Whenever a thread comes up about stroke, the repeated line is how rare stroke is and how there isn't a shown causal relationship between chiropractic and stroke. However, I know a lot of chiropractors who specifically mention stroke on their informed consent form (albeit with a line about how rare the occurrence is).

If stroke is this rare and not related, is it important to directly call it out? Do you also list out ever possible side effect like a list of bullet points, even the extremely rare ones that may not have a proven causal relationship with chiropractic? Will chiropractors mention stroke solely because of cultural reasons, and if so does that perpetuate the issue, or is there a good reason to mention stroke?

1306,Chiropractic,"Hello!  3 years ago I went to a chiropractor complaining of a tight neck.  He asked me to get x rays which i did and discovered my neck needed the curve fixed and recommended to see him 2-3 days a week for 9 months and use the denneroll each night.  Im a piano player who's had back and neck issues from poor posture so it wasn't a surprise i had issues.  After the first adjustment my neck got stiff as a robot, he claimed this was normal?  

anyway luckily it did go away after a few days.  I proceeded to see him for another two weeks and started to notice greater rotation in my neck. as well when i sat at the piano i had zero back issues all of a sudden and it felt great.  I also found myself wanting to sit taller, and not lean over the table when eating my dinner.  All good things i imagine.

However, 3 weeks later after treatments I got a bad cold and started to get a clicking sound when talking or burping near my right ear/jaw.  I called the chiropractor and he said to contact an ENT.  So i went to 3 Ent's and they could not find the problem.  I also went to two dentists, and  2 other chiropractors for opinions.  Nobody has been able to figure it out.  The other two chiropractors do not think its related to chiropractic adjustments.

Long story short... im curious what this community thinks ... could this weird clicking sound I get when talking be a result of getting my neck adjusted?  Is it possible the adjustments put something else out of line?  Strange thing is when ever i get a cold now, the clicking subsides for the duration of the cold.  

I'd hate to think the chiropractor i saw messed me up for life with this annoying issue i've been forced to accept and live with.  Luckily it is not painful, but as a musician and teacher, its unbelievably annoying and depressing as every note i Sing or word I say usual ends with this internal clicking sound  near my ear.

The problem is not how big my muscle are but how they feel. On the left side their loose and they aren't tensing up while working out.

1319,Chiropractic,"This is my first time using a chiropractor. I recently injured my lower back and I tried to do as much research on my local chiropractors and went with a Gonstead chiropractor in South Florida. 

First visit was pretty standard, he consulted me and did a physical and history along with getting my Xrays while standing up. He took it multiple times (\~4) because he was a perfectionist. I was told to schedule for a 2nd visit because the DC doesn't do same day diagnosis and was charged $300 ($75 for consultation and $225 for the xray). 

I scheduled for the next morning and came in and he diagnosed what I assumed was happening to me, L5 herniated disc (although I've been told to truly diagnose herniated disc requires an MRI scan), and it matches my symptoms of not able to bend forward or back past a certain point without feeling a sharp pain. He then tells me ""great news"" how this is a mechanical problem more so than a medical one and he is confident to take on my case. He initially told me he wanted to see me for **six months** ($2800) and then dropped it down to 2 months ($990). When I asked the front desk lady if I could just do 1 month to try and see they told me the DC won't take my case unless it is 2 months or more because he requires a certain amount of time with me to get me healed. It just seems to be a lot of red flags but is this expected? I understand each DC has a treatment plan but locking me in for 2 months or more after charging me $300 left a sour taste in my mouth.

Currently valued at about 791M, I'm pretty sure it's worth more than all of the chiropractic colleges and professional associations. When I was in outpatient clinic, my staff doctor had bought and opened a franchise location. At the time I thought it was dumb, that they weren't charging enough for care, and why pay the franchise fee at all, just open your own practice. 

I get a lot of patients from there. People who are wanting a more focused experience and better quality care. Having never been there myself, I wonder what the experience is like for patients and patients as customers. I'm imagining it's efficient and a good value, if somewhat inconsistent depending on which chiropractor they end up seeing. 

I'm really just bullish on the company because I believe in chiropractic as a product. And I feel like long after I've closed my doors and stopped practicing, their locations will keep working and probably open new ones. So why not continue to benefit in some way by being an investor?

A couple years ago I was at a trampoline park with my kid. I did a butt bounce and felt my middle back scream out. If you put your hand right underneath the front of you rib cage, it was the opposite side on the back.

I was really sore for a few weeks. This subsided into a general discomfort, and I felt this need to constantly stretch that area of my back , but I could never find the correct position. I also experienced a slight decrease in mobility when twisting my torso. This was not debilitating. I could still lift with no pain, just a general discomfort and need to stretch. I experienced it for almost 3 years.

I recently started jiu-jitsu.

At one of my first classes, I was drilling a back mount escape.

Here's a link to a pic for example. I would be the guy in the blue gi.

 [1.jpg (250√ó188) (ultimatejujitsu.com)](https://www.ultimatejujitsu.com/images/techniques/foot-lock-against-the-back-mount/1.jpg) 

I was slightly arched towards my partner, attempting to escape, when my partner pulled back on me to regain more control. His feet had my thighs immobile, and he had one arm hooked under my armpit. He basically pulled me gently and firmly into a more arched position while keeping my lower body immobile.

I finally got that stretch I've been looking for. It hurt so good is the only way I can describe it. I also had five distinct cracks in my middle back. I groaned loudly in relief. My partner thought I was hurt. I just laid there for a moment basking in relief, and then carried on with the drill.

My middle back muscles were a bit sore that night, not painful, more like DOMS. A little advil took care of the soreness that night. The next day I was no longer sore, and my back felt great for the first time in years.

Ever since, I've been discomfort free, my mobility has increased, and I don't feel the need to stretch.

I went because my knees felt painful about an 8/10 at its worst, it felt like my patellar tendon was bruised and very tender to the touch. This started a couple of months ago thought it was just from heavy squats as I had knee pain in my right knee on July 26th of 2021 and asked a family friend who did heavy weightlifting and is a registered dietitian as well as a director of kinesiology at a university so he knows how to do things the right way, with the correct form with low weight, etc...

1396,Chiropractic,"Good Evening, 

I've been experiencing some significant lower back pain over the last couple weeks. I'm pretty sure it's from a work related injury where I was rushing and bending and lifting improperly.
I was referred to a chiropractor and I went in for a preliminary visit where the chiropractor took x rays and measurements and told me on my next visit that he would review the x rays and go over my treatment plan. Before even doing all this, he prefaced that my pain was likely from a misalignment of my neck that was causing strain on the rest of my body. He said I was too young (I'm 32) to have significant back pain from over extending it or bending or lifting improperly. 
I was charged $45 for this initial visit. 
I returned less then a week later to review the x rays. The doctor showed me my x rays and said my hip and spine were perfect and there was nothing wrong there. He said my neck was misaligned and it was the root cause of all my pain. I'm not an expert, but looking at the x rays, my neck looked relatively normal. 
He then started talking to me about NUCCA, which I hadn't heard of before. He explained what he would do and it would correct my lower back pain. 
He then went over the pricing. He said I would be given 13 visits and I would have to pay $3000 in advance or 3 monthly payments of $1000. The first visit would be the only time he would do any corrections. The rest would be follow up visits where he would check if I'm healing properly. 
He said there was no option to pay one visit at a time. I said I would have to think about it and he tried to pressure me into making an appointment first. He did say if I make an appointment for the initial correction, then I would have to put some money down as it is a significant block of time if I were to cancel.
After that I just said I would call them at the end of the week. 
I did further research on online after and found out a lot more about NUCCA and I don't see any justification for paying $3000 in advance for this procedure when it only includes one correction

Have had good success avoiding any kind of surgery my whole life and I'd like to keep this trend rolling if possible, so looking for something to thin my bile out, maybe help address what I think are cholesterol-based stones if I have any stones at all.

1408,Chiropractic,"Been seeing a chiro for some time now and seeing minimal results. One thing that he tested was my HRV. I sat down and put the tips of my fingers on some pad and sat there for a few minutes. It calculated my HRV and then he did an adjustment on me. I asked how the HRV device works and that from what I know you need weeks worth of constant HRV tracking to have enough data to come to conclusions. He said no and explained how this new device is able to track your HRV in less than 5 minutes.

Of course they said how they could help, how so many people really befit from atlas orthogonal, and people come as far as three hours away for treatment.

Not just sore, but actually hurts. I called the place the place the next morning frantic, and they assured me that pain was perfect normal. I waited two weeks and the pain got better but never fully subsided. Decided to give them one more try, but the pain never went away.

I called in again and voiced my frustration. I was firm but was never disrespectful. I said how I felt even worse off than when I began.

1414,Chiropractic,"Don't quite know where to start, looking for some advice, I guess. Completely aware I'm going to sound dumb here, but anyways. I finished up my 4th trimester (out of 11) a couple of weeks ago. For about a year now I've been having second thoughts about studying Chiropractic. I don't really have anything negative to say about the profession, my issues with it are more personal. Some background info:

* I am terrified of the Income to Debt ratio, especially starting out. Living away from home and being a Canadian studying in the states, I'm probably looking at around $250K CAD in loans when this is all said and done. I fear the earning potential and what that means in a HCOL city like Toronto. I‚Äôm kind of a risk adverse person and the financial uncertainty brings me great anxiety. My intention would be to start a practice, but I worry I would have to provide service that I do not agree with to make a livable wage. I‚Äôm curious to hear from other Ontario Chiros regarding this.

* Feels like I'm here for the wrong reasons. I look at the love and passion my classmates have for Chiropractic and I just don't share it. My priority is to make a good living. I was stuck in a hard place and didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. This profession, with an application process that accepts anyone with a pulse, threw me a branch and I took it.

* I attend a small Evidence-Based School. The profs here honestly aren't great, it really doesn't help. They are knowledgeable but grossly unorganized. Teaching is probably their last priority and it shows. This is a common sentiment among my cohort. 

* I have a lot of regrets and spend a lot of time looking back. Its unhealthy. I am not happy that I'm a Chiropractic student, nor do I have an ounce of pride in the fact. Would I hate my life as a Chiro, probably not? I'm solid at the few adjustments we've learned, and school is kind of a cakewalk so I don't have a problem picking up the material. But I sometimes struggle to care about the material, and often tune out my peer‚Äôs conversations about Chiropractic.  

My dilemma is, I've been debating a switch to IT for a while. I have a love for computers and tech, they are my passion in life and working with them brings me genuine joy. I've learnt a lot in the past year and honestly think I'd be quite successful in that industry. Every field has its challenges, but it feels like there is more money and less stress in IT for a person like me. Sounds fine and dandy, but sunk cost fallacy. I'm 25 y/o and already 16 months deep into the program with 100k CAD of student loan debt. Why didn't I go into IT from the get go? I didn't know it was an option as a Biology graduate. Didn't learn until I was already a Chiro student. From people I've had this talk with, I've been told that there is indeed great money in Chiro and doing both at the same time may be a good way to go, but I don't see how. It would make Chiro one hell of an expensive safety blanket, and honestly seems nonsensical, you aren't going to be successful in either field if you don't give em 100% of your time and effort. 

Don't know, just venting at this point. I'm curious if any other students here have doubts, and what you've done to address them. Same for any practicing Chiros, did you have doubts, any lingering regrets? Did you suck it up and go through the program anyways? Would you do it all again in hindsight?","Current Student, Constantly Having Regrets and Second Thoughts"

1431,Chiropractic,"## What causes poor posture?

Conditions which impair one or more of the body's supporting structures, such as the spine, back muscles, hips, shoulders, neck and abdominal wall, can also create posture issues.

People with hereditary disorders that impact the curvature of the spine and hips can correct posture from birth in some situations. Such problems can be addressed to reduce the negative impact on posture which they can have over time. In some situations, injuries sustained while participating in sports or other activities might change posture, as the body attempts to protect itself from further injuries (such as limping when your foot is injured).

Our posture often changes due to our work or other activities which cause misuse of various body parts. Underuse can be a concern as well. Weak back muscles on either side of the spine, or weak abdominal wall muscles in front of our bodies, for example, might make it difficult to maintain excellent posture.

Many people's muscles and ligaments tighten or weaken due to sitting for long periods of time. This can also result in bad posture.

## Tips for how to improve your posture

* Regular exercise, even a brisk 10-minute walk, can help improve your overall health and posture by keeping your body supple and active.
* Gentle workouts like yoga and Pilates can help strengthen and improve your posture by improving the support muscles in your back and stomach. Concentrate on strengthening your core muscles (torso and pelvis) daily.
* Simple stretching exercises should be done for 10 minutes each day.
* Stand tall by straightening your spine, lowering your shoulders to their natural resting position and inhaling deeply to contract your abdominal muscles.
* Simple head movements can help release tight neck muscles which can make it difficult to maintain excellent posture. Make little circles with your head, or move it from front to back and side to side.
* Allow your body to restore its normal resting position by lying flat on the ground on your back for two to three minutes once a day, without utilizing any cushions or support.
* To aid in even weight distribution, wear flat, well-fitting shoes.
* Lift objects with your hips, knees, and thighs rather than your back.

## What you can do at home

When seated, avoid crossing your legs since it can overstretch one side of your leg muscles and alter the alignment of your spine over time (especially if you cross your legs the same way, every time). Spend as little time as possible on low-sitting sofas or particularly soft chairs. When sleeping, try to utilize a single firm support pillow to avoid neck strain. Lying on your side with your knees bent is the best position; make sure you have a firm mattress as well.

Make sure the weight of any luggage or heavy objects is distributed evenly on both sides of your body. Weight can be distributed equally over your shoulders with a backpack. If you're a caregiver who spends a lot of time lifting, pushing or carrying the person you're caring for, make sure you're taking care of your posture.

How to improve your workplace posture

Keep your back straight, knees and hips level, and your feet flat on the ground while seated. To keep your hips and knees level, you might make use of a footrest. If you sit for long periods, you should use a small rolled towel or a commercial device to support your lower back against the back of your chair.

When using a laptop or desktop computer, avoid sitting in a slumped position for long periods. Make sure you get up and walk around frequently to keep your body in a looser position. Ask your company for training on how to lift and carry big or bulky, awkward goods, if your employment requires a lot of repetitive activities such as lifting and bending.

You may get phone strain if you spend a lot of time on the phone. A headset is more comfortable than laying your phone on your shoulder and twisting your neck to keep it in place.

## How to improve your driving posture

To ensure safe and comfortable driving, ensure your car seat and headrest are in the proper positions. Adjust the steering wheel so it‚Äôs level with your chest rather than your face. Bend your arms and place your thumbs on the steering wheel's rim. Set yourself deep in the seat, supporting your body with your left foot, and keep the seat reasonably upright to support your back and shoulders.

1433,Chiropractic,"I hope this post is appropriate for the sub.

I bought a chirp wheel for my chronic upper back and neck pain. And while it helped in some regard, it started causing stiffness in the muscles surrounding my upper spine. It wasn't all the muscles, it seemed like inner muscles. I'd most notice an issue when I twist even for normal activities like sitting up, looking to the side, or pushing a button on a microwave (indirect twist via my arm), or reaching upwards. 

A couple times I pulled a very specific small strip of muscle next to my spine that caused a burning sensation every 10 seconds. I called it a ""hot fork"", felt like someone was scraping a sideways hot fork down my back. This burning lasted over a week and no stretching, resting, or painkillers would help it. I couldn't sleep and I was miserable. I thought this occurred due to something else, but it happened again without the external factor and determined it was from the wheel.

I let my mom (who also has upper back pain) use the wheels to see if I could give them to her. At first she loved it and it cracked her back. The second time she had the same issue with the spine stiffness. So I will be returning them.

We were both gentle with the rolling, no sudden movements during.

1438,Chiropractic,"Straight to the point I'm a dumbass with OCD and I sometimes do overstretching. Lately I've been hung up on doing kind of a shrug while bent over neck neutral arms out to each side (usually natural, pronated or supinated) and I'll shrug pretty fucking hard over and over until I feel a crack or pop in the neck traps upper back shoulder area. (I get those feelings when doing other stretches sometime that has been deemed safe) but I'll be honest this is unfortunately s new ritual for me so I'm trying to avoid it. It does not help that my lef tshouldrr feels bad and pops sometimes but I'm pretty sure that's because of posture. I do weightlifting and I need to work on some stabilizer muscles and stretch my biceps tendon and shoulders. The stretches seem to be working for it but I want to go to the chiropractor anyway to address the shoulder which feels good 80 of the time and 20 it feels a little bad

The problem now is that I am certain when I do the chin tucks earlier this week (after a massive nice pop and shrug) had made no noise but now it makes those crackling noises because I tried to do the shrug thing again due to the ritual. 

Why does this happen?

I want to just do full stop now but if it's a chance to quiet my neck down while doing tucks then I don't want to 

I've had neck noise like that all my life so I'm pretty sure it's been normal for me none the less it's just weird that I had several days with no crackling anywhere except my shoulder after my shrug release thing but now it's all noise again.

1439,Chiropractic,"Hi all, I'm not looking for free medical advice, I'm just hoping that someone can point me in the right direction of the right kind of medical professional to see. I've tried seeing soft tissue therapists and a chiropractor and so far no one has been able to successfully help me with my issue.
I'm 32 and about 2 years ago my neck started cracking / crunching when I turn my head to the left. It happens every time I do this movement so it isn't likely to be gas bubbles. I have not had a significant physical injury that could have brought it on, and given that I'm still quite young I doubt it is arthritis (?) . I get a lot of neck pain, although not specifically when I crack it, &amp; I believe it must be linked.
I have spent hundreds on the chiropractor, who seemed to help at first but after the first couple of sessions there wasn't any change. Now he does accupuncture to alleviate it a bit and has given me some neck exercises (the exercises do help to temporarily ease the pain), but it feels like he is treating the symptoms and not the root cause of the issue. I need someone who is going to be able to identify what is causing the cracking and fix it as it doesn't seem right at my age.

If anyone has any advice on what the right kind of medical practitioner would be for me to see (e.g. An osteopath, physio, or even another Chiropractor) then I would greatly appreciate it as I don't have a lot of money for 'trial and error' and the pain is really hindering my quality of life.

1448,Chiropractic,"Hi all,

Not looking for medical advice - looking to answer this question objectively so I can decide to either go back to my doctor, or, book to see a chiropractor if needed. 

For context:

I figured this would be the best place to ask this question. I asked my doctor a few weeks ago and he couldn‚Äôt see a link between the two actions.

I have a (terrible) habit of cracking my own neck, probably 5-10 times a day. I know that I need to stop this, but I‚Äôm really struggling to break the habit. The second part of this is that for the last 3 months or so I‚Äôve had chest pain - I think the two might be related. The pain is centre right of my chest, and it gets worse if I stretch in certain positions. I would describe the pain as similar to pushing a bruise. Could my neck cracking be causing this?

I wanted to ask this community as I think you‚Äôll have better knowledge and expertise in this area.

Appreciate any feedback. Thank you.",Does cracking your own neck (non-professionally) cause chest pain?

1456,Chiropractic,"21 yo, male, healthy for the most part.

Around April I most likely herniated a disc which caused me to be flexion intolerant in the lumbar region. I am still dealing with low back pain but am confident that will be resolved. What I am quite worried about is my midback/ neck pain. I have tried *quite* a bit: foam rolling, mobility training, stretching, strengthening, dry needling, massage, electric stimulus (H-Wave), chiro, NSAIDS... and to no avail. 

In May I went to the chiro to help deal with my mid back/ low back and he did a manual adjustment which helped tremendously, I think. I was pain free for about a couple of weeks then it started to come back. At this time I was seeing the clinic regularly and they were going down each of the spinous processes with a gun and ""adjusting"" me with that apparatus. I saw no change in low back pain. I decided to leave that clinic since I was seeing little to no progress in the low back area when I was dealing with a ton of pain.

Later in the summer I went to go see a DPT and we did a ton of work that did nothing for any part of my body really. Bunch of dry needling.

Now I am seeing a chiro and he took three tests - [HRV](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-rate-variability-new-way-track-well-2017112212789), [thermal](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Advances-in-Paraspinal-Thermographic-Analysis-Wallace-Wallace/4d0b1b3dbf97dde1354a74deab91156f31562af5?p2df), [EMG](http://www.mccoypress.net/resources/cla/semg_review.pdf). Here were my [results](https://www.loom.com/share/c5d4d375c14140bdb9696b3b3b13fa9d) explained by the dr.

The tests show that I am making progress and I guess I am. My pain is less intense and not as frequent, but I still feel terrible... especially around the cervical/ thoracic area. I wanted your guys' advice on whether or not I should keep seeing the chiro for my adjustments or cancel my treatment plan and go else where. I paid $1,400 and I certainly don't feel like I got what I paid for at all. The treatment plan was three months and I am one month in. 

Currently I am doing the McGill method for fixing my low back. I am very confident my low back will resolve, but I am worried about my midback/ neck area. The pain I feel in the mid back is typically a throbbing sensation. I used to work as a waiter where I would constantly be picking up plates and trays and putting them down. At the end of my shift my mid back would just be warm and throbbing in pain. It was a localized area as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/ndGwRSp). The top image was when I got out of work and came home (2 months ago). The bottom image was just a few days ago where at night I was feeling a ""line"" from both spots. Standing for long periods of time will trigger my pain and recently if I compress my ribcage (think CPR) I will notice that line be triggered (bottom image).

I am just frustrated and wanted your opinions on how I can move forward. Should I keep seeing my chiro or look else where?

1460,Chiropractic,"Hi,

I was getting treatment for my shoulders and the practitioner also did my neck and lower back. The way he did lower back adjustment was by having me lay on my side and bring my one leg up to toward the face. Then, he would press my shoulder and knee so that my waist will twist. 

When my back did not crack, he said he wanted to have ""another go"" and put more body weight. My back still didn't go off. It was a bit painful but it wasn't anything serious then. After this day, though, it started to throb. Now it hurts to the point where I cannot bend over without having pain in my lower back. It's been a week since that bad treatment occurred.

anyway, I love getting adjustments (if you're in school to be a chiropractor and need a test dummy, I'm free and very willing) and yes doing my own adjustment. I used to be able to crack my neck and back EXTREMELY well (like youtube worthy crunch noises...) but a few years ago I broke my tailbone (ouch....) for the second time in my life. I had to sleep on my back for months (and I'm a side only sleeper) but it was way too painful any other way. I also couldn't flex/stretch/move my body in any kind of way to crack it (I'd do the twist to each side thing) so ever since then I've lost my ability to crack on my own as well (I'd say I'm at 10% where I once was) so that's weird right? (because if I go to a chiropractor with enough force they can get the job done!) my right side of my neck is so bad that when it's stretched in certain ways I feel an almost air pocket in my ear/jaw area that literally builds with pressure until I can get to the point of one measly crack.....  

but that's not the weirdest thing.... standing up for long periods of time isn't fun and I used to get HORRIBLE back pain that I clearly couldn't elevate on my own til on accident one day I was sitting on a step stool and the way I was sitting it was almost as if my tailbone was touching the curve where the top and side of the stool met and if I would lean back, my back literally feels like it drops back into place! it feels amazing but I must admit sometimes the noise (coming from a lover of the sound of bones cracking) is a bit startlingly how forceful it seems to go back down (sorry that's the only way I can describe it. I've been able to modify the adjustment technique to work sometimes sitting indian style on a hard tile floor and with my hips/tailbone area being the last contact point on the floor, sit perfect posture, hold onto my knees with my hands for an opposite force that allows the same thing to happen. what the hell is going on!",what's wrong with my bonez? :/

1471,Chiropractic,"Hey there

Not sure if it‚Äôs the best place to post this but here goes. I‚Äôm a bit of a hypocondriac first off!!

I‚Äôve had sciatica on off for many years - eventually going to see a chiropractor a few years back where the x ray showed my pelvis was out of alignment, due to one leg being slightly longer than the other. General wear and tear as well as a herniated disc! (I think l5-s1). So after a few cracks and I felt much better for a while. But over lockdown and a few bad deadlifts and squats the pain came back and so I returned to the same chiropractor this week.

Instant relief. The usual pressure I felt in my lower right side of my back is gone ever since. We did before and after tests of how high I could lift my leg in terms of glutes and hamstring strength and there was a big difference.

I‚Äôm assuming this changed the position of how my leg is sitting slightly (it‚Äôs what it feels like, again not in a bad way). Within 10 minutes of leaving the chiropractor my hamstring and calf started to cramp up. It felt like it was the first time I‚Äôd been using the muscles or something! By the time I got home my calf was in ribbons. The muscle has been so cramped and sore but getting better every day.

I‚Äôm assuming nerve supply to these muscles is enhanced and my leg is working better ! It feels like the pressure I used to feel in my lower back is now going through my calf and hamstring where it should be going!

The thing is - and what I noticed is my calf on this leg is so weak! It‚Äôs a real challenge to do a single leg standing calf raise here. I can just about do a few if I‚Äôm not fatigued and it‚Äôs very hard to get a deep connection at the end. Feels very weak. And I can only assume it‚Äôs been like this for a while and I never noticed. I can do double leg fine and I can get good muscle contractions there when I have my weight supported. fatigues easily though and like I said it‚Äôs still very sore. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been blitzed!

Now the panic side of me that has only suddenly noticed this is in a sudden panic I have motor neuron or something and it‚Äôs a first sign. The rational side of me thinks it‚Äôs oobviously connected to the herniated disc and the adjustment.

But is there anyone who could shed some light on what‚Äôs happened here specifically and why I don‚Äôt have motor neuron üòÇ

Thanks guys",Herniated disc and weak calf
1472,Chiropractic,"I've had a constant headache problem since I was 14. I saw several different types of doctors and tried many things (mostly migraine treatments) and nothing ever helped. I saw a chiropractor many years ago for about a month which didn't provide relief. I don't think he took any xrays.

Despite the issue never going away, and gradually developing chronic back pain in the past few years, I never had a clue what was wrong with me until I randomly stumbled upon the concept of ""cervicogenic headache"" online. I arranged for a consult at a spine/physical therapy rehab place and they showed me I have scoliosis and straightening of the cervical lordosis.

Suddenly all of the weird indescribable pain/discomfort I've always felt makes total sense. Unlike every other condition I was persuaded to believe (and wanted to believe out of desperation for answers) was causing my problem, this actually makes things clear and gives me hope for the first time in a long time.

It seems like what I need is a care regimen at a rehab center with a combination of physical therapy, chiropractic care, acupuncture, technologies like pettibon, spinal decompression etc. The rehab clinic I am considering paying is suggesting a few sessions per week for a few weeks, then I should have a lot of relief that will last with some regular at home maintenance and periodic visits. Money is tight however and I am worrying about investing too much into the wrong care.  

I did some research and it seems like the consensus based on statistics is that chiropractic care is generally safe and can be beneficial even if it simply provides temporary relief. However some chiro's make bold claims such as being able to correct scoliosis and that is what you need to be careful of. One rehab center I had an evaluation at said the curve might change a little but most likely won't change. The chiropractor at the other, more affordable one claims with their ""posture correction process"" the curve will be corrected...

**TL,DR: Should I tell the chiropractor I want to avoid posture correction and focus on other things? Should I avoid paying for chiro and focus on P/T and acupuncture?

He has done this about four times over the course of several weeks, and this have been somewhat painful in the lumbar spine area. Any pain or discomfort from the adjustment goes away almost immediatly when i stand up and never returns when i leave the office. However this morning, as im getting into position and waiting for the adjustment, he stops as if he just thought of something, takes a look at my xrays that are on the wall (i assume as i am facedown, but i hear him take a step in that direction) and then says something along the lines of ""Ahh yes, we count up from L6 to find t12.""

I just came from my first visit to a chiropractor in a long time and she mentioned that my neck is in an S-curve. She repeatedly asked if I had been in a bad car accident (whiplash), thrown from a horse, etc. I honestly don't have any memory of anything like that.

I was wondering what other type of things could cause that? She really wants me to try to remember and now I'm like ugh did something happen to me and I blocked it or something. :-/

Any help would be appreciated!",Question about S-curve neck cause
