    "We can see that all 3 models performed significantly better than the baseline, but the best model based on lowest RMSE is the **XGBoost Regressor**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It might also be important to note that the baseline model is basically a single **float** of about 0.4 distributed equally across all shop-item combinations. However, this is not a realistic situation, as we can only sell products in whole numbers. Hence, for the evaluation of the trained models, prediction results were **rounded to full integers**. This may explain why there is such a significant difference between the aggregate sum of the baseline model compared to the actual models. \n",

    "We basically needed a effective and efficient method to generate accurate forecasts in spite of the **complexities** involved. \n",

    "Given the **scale and scope of 1Câ€™s product range and geographical presence**, it would be a challenge for traditional forecasting methods to address factors such as **seasonality and trends** at the granular level. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we managed to develop a **XGBoost Regressor model** to consider all these factors and produce a forecast with a decent **RMSE of 1.038**. This model is also sufficiently robust to predict future sales for products with **little to no historical data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This XGBoost model is also **relatively speedy**, and can complete training and predicting in under 10 mins. Definitely a big win for Planners who are currently slaving for many hours, or even days, to produce a reasonable forecast each month. With this model, Planners can now redirect their resources towards better cross-functional alignments in the Sales and Operations Planning process. \n"
