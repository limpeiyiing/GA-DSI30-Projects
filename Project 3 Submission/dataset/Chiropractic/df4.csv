Chiropractic,"Late 20s female student with interscapular pain and low back pain. Described as constant aching and stiffness. 4/10 average, 10/10 at its worst. Insidious onset. Occasional pain in arms and hips described as “tightness.” Sitting and lifting anything exacerbates pain. Muscle relaxers briefly helped. Urgent care ruled out kidney pathology. Denies headaches. History of anorexia.

Sounds pretty typical until I start the physical exam.

No positive ortho exams but the exams caused excruciating pain in areas not being tested. For example, SLR produced pain in the traps that caused her to writhe in pain, cervical compression caused pain in R low back. Light palpation around rhomboids/traps was almost unbearable, same with light palpation around the low back and hips. Muscle tests all normal. Nerve tension tests all normal. ROM pretty normal for the most part.

I tried (extremely) light ART and could barely get anything done without her being in agony. To the point where she stated she was getting lightheaded. 

Had her do simple exercises such as Cat/Cow, No Money, Scaption raise…all illicit terrible pain that caused her to have to take a break and catch her breath.

So yeah, kind of stumped on this one. Wondering if I should be looking into any auto-immune or dietary disorders? Or is this something super simple that I’m dumb for not knowing. Thanks in advance.",Got a case that has me stumped. Any ideas?
Chiropractic,"I have lost the curve in my neck. Last time I had an MRI it said I may have a slight bulge in C5-C6.
 
I got the MRI bc when I would relax, something would shift in my neck and then it would feel like my legs were in hot water, like I’d lose feeling in them. I went off of a certain med that was causing akathesia, which stopped the episodes except when I take an edible for pain and I’m over relaxed. 

Every now and then my feet will involuntarily kick out if I’m laying a certain way or reading (looking down, I already have a major neck hump).

I plan to get an update MRI because I have less feeling in my left hand and arm then I do my right, and tingling in the last two fingers since tweaking my neck while driving. What I want to know is, even with a dowagers hump and if I do wind up having a bulging disc, is it safe to have my neck adjusted despite my history? Or should I avoid it.

Chiropractic,"I was getting some sharp lower back pain from weightlifting and decided to visit a chiropractor recently. From their diagnoses, my disc is hitting my nerve causing me to have pain. Not sure if that is a herniated disc, or something of that nature (if anyone can help me understand more that’d be lovely). I really get sharp pains when I bend over or squat down. 

All they proceeded to do was “adjust”/crack my back and neck. They only do my neck because it doesn’t bend fully one way. After the first session, my back felt worse.

I’m supposed to have multiple session in a short time period, and I’m sure all of it’s going to be is the same two cracks in my back (the one where you lean towards them and one knee is out and they push down on your back) and two in my neck.

Chiropractic,"Late last year while my chiro took x-rays, he informed me that I have an extra vertebra, and not just that, he said there was some sort of deformity involved, he put something like ""it doesn't know if it wants to be a vertebrae or part of your sacrum"" or something to this effect. I was shocked to find this out as I have never had any lower back pain, and I have always been active for as long i can remember with no issues.

Immediately get concerned. 

It’s now been a week and I’m getting worried from hearing all these stories about neck adjustments causing permanent damage or vertigo symptoms. Call me crazy, ever since my neck has been adjusted, I’ve had weird visual sensations. For example, I would focus on something, then my eyes would unfocus and readjust for a split second randomly throughout the day. 

I spoke to the actual chiropractor at my job, and he said to never do any neck adjustments and especially by a physical therapist who is not licensed to do adjustments.  He tried to avoid adjusting necks actually.

Chiropractic,"A few months ago (March, today is June) I (21F) saw a chiropractor for the first time. I was having bad back pain, pain around my shoulder blades, shoulder, and neck pain. I also have a few other conditions (fibromyalgia, POTS, some mental illnesses) so just keep that in mind as you read. he took x-rays and diagnosed me with scoliosis and said my neck curves the wrong way. After the first adjustment I felt great until the soreness hit. I know it’s expected to have soreness the first 24-48 hours but my back never started feeling better. I ended up not going back because I was afraid something went wrong and going back would make it worse. I have horrible anxiety surrounding healthcare providers so I’ve basically just been dodging his calls but it’s gotten to the point where my lower back hurts so bad sometimes I can barely walk. I’ve been doing stretches but nothing seems to help even gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Problem is, I no longer have insurance and can’t afford to pay the bill without tapping into credit cards.

Chiropractic,"Hi everyone, I am posting this as I need some advice on what I should do. So I applied to chiro school and physio school and was fortunate to get offers at both in Ontario! However, I am struggling to decide what one would be the best choice for me. 

I was leaning toward physio school since there is more stability (hospital jobs) plus it fewer years in school (2 years). However, working in the hospital and seeing what the physio do makes me rethink this stability fact. To be honest, I think what they do in the hospital (getting people up and walking) is relatively boring and I am not sure if I would see myself doing that for the rest of my life. I know I could always work in a clinic but I heard the pay is significantly less (including benefits and stuff) and it takes away that stability aspect. I also see a lot of physio working in interdisciplinary teams really only teach and watch exercises solely as a treatment approach. I also don't think that I would be satisfied with doing this. 

On the other hand, I feel like chiro school would be a good opportunity since I could really develop my manual therapy techniques. I think it fits better what I am looking for out of a career compared to physio. However, as a chiro, I feel like you can only work in a clinic (hospital jobs are rare) and the population you treat is not that varied (you pretty much mostly work with back and neck pain)

I get that chiro is more tuition and more schooling (it's 4 years instead of 2 years) but I rather choose something I love for the long haul and at the end of the day the money difference doesn’t make a huge difference to me. What do you guys think? Any advice would be appreciated! 

On a side note, I have seen many people in this sub recommend physician assistants. I got in that too (I had no idea what I wanted out of a career when applying) but am shying away from that since I really don't want my scope limited by someone else and rather not be 50 years old working under a 30-year-old doctor.",chiro vs physio

Chiropractic,"The title is vague, let me explain. Basically, I've been seeing a chiropractor for a few years now. I was consistent initially when it was helpful with most of my then problems (migranes, sleep, neck pain, etc). I started seeing him less over the last 2 years.

Chiropractic,"Hello, I’m a relatively healthy 33F who over the last few months has been dealing with a painless clicking sound every time I turn my head to the right, and then back to center. Sometimes it is louder than others, I think depending on how tense I am and how aware of the clicking I am in that moment. Sometimes I don’t notice it at all but when I’m in a completely silent environment it drives me insane. Sometimes when it is worse I notice more clicking or almost like a faint sandpaper sound in my neck too. Every few weeks I’ll have a day where I notice a louder sandpapery sound that is very unsettling, but it typically goes away within a day. I’m trying to figure out if those episodes correlate to periods of higher stress.

I’ve been going to a chiropractor for a few months who doesn’t seem to have done much for the issue, nor do they seem concerned/treats it like no big deal/shrugs it off even though it’s very much affecting my mental health. Same with the osteopath I’ve seen. I also went as far as to see a spine specialist. They took multiple X-rays and ruled out stuff like instability/hyper mobility, and said my cervical spine looked totally fine and also told me not to worry about the noise.

I suppose I am just stubborn for not listening to the pros when the tell me not to worry, but it’s hard not to. I mean - it is my neck! I’ve also noticed some clicking in my jaw lately which I am worried could be related however I also suspect it could be realtors to bruxism I developed from taking a medication. 

Anyways - last week I had a consultation with a NUCCA chiro. We went through my recent X-rays and noticed some misalignments in my cervical and lumbar spine. When I described the clicking to him his explanation was that the spine obviously isn’t moving correctly. The treatment plan he offers looks like $625 up front which sees reasonable after browsing this sub. I’m not too concerned about the money. I’m really interested to see what the atlas X-ray would show. I’m hopeful that the targeted treatment would help me resolve the issue (and help me just feel better in general and I do have various other aches and pains). However, I am nervous that the treatment could somehow make the noise worse? Does anyone here think that would be possible? I’m at the point where I am willing to try anything but very nervous of making things worse. Any input would be appreciated!! Thank you for reading.",Opinions on NUCCA for noisy neck

Chiropractic,"My subtalar joints are compacted and I’ve been to two different chiropractors who couldn’t get it to release. I have the name of a third but I’m at the point where I’m questioning if I’m just throwing money away for something that can’t be solved. 

In my shoes, would you give a third chiro a chance or save your money and accept having super tight ankles?","If two chiropractors couldn’t do it, would you go to a third?"

Chiropractic,"Hi, I’m a 31 year old female who recent developed back pain and subsequent mri lumbar showed lumbar facet djd mild-moderate on most lumbar levels. 

I have low back pain. That started 2.5 months ago. I use to lift, also stressful work (a lot of sitting standing which I have been trying to really change but hard to do that). 

This low back pain worse with sitting for long, or standing for long. Another thing is I develop this burning back pain as well that can involved my thoracic area when I try to stretch/do any strenuous exercise. 

Will chiropractor be helpful in my case? If anyone can give me any help. I would appreciate it very much.

Chiropractic,"I went to my chiropractor 2 times now. The first time I told him about the pain in my upper back and he just took some medical records and just adjusted me a little bit in my back where I told him I have pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd time he just adjusted me for like 13 mins and after asking me what activity causes pain as I told him my job work gives me pain so I showed him the motion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I thinking he should be asking me questions on how I stand or sit and how this problem happened initially and maybe exercise techniques or maybe x rays or anything at all?

&amp;#x200B;

thank you.",Is my Chiropractor good?
