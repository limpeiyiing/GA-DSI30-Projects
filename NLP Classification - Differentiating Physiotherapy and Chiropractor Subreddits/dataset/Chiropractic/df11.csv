Chiropractic,"Curious as I’ve had 3 consults with different UC chiropractors and they all want to sign me up for long term treatment plans that cost a lot up front and it feels scammy. They all told me that if I don’t sign up for the treatments they can’t help me. Is this typical for UC treatments?  While the consults were slightly different they followed the same pattern. X-rays, they then show me how bad it is and they can’t make any guarantees but try a “test adjustment” and then tell me things look promising after running some device up my neck to show me the jagged line is “straighter” (looks like an ekg paper) and that they think they can help (as long as I sign up for the treatment plan).

Chiropractic,"I had been seeing chiropractors for 6 years and the pain/condition never really improved. My neck and upper back were constantly in pain. Sessions helped... for a few days or so. Then the pain would return. Last year, I decided to start seeing a new chiropractor who specializes in upper cervical. After tests and X-rays, she told me I have Stage 1 Spinal Degeneration. She uses a machine that adjusts my atlas bone. After about a year, I could be in maintenance mode where I only have to see her once a month or so. It's been 5 months and I've noticed a big difference. Seeing her once a week now. Soon I should be down to every other week. Here's my questions.

Is stage 1 of Spinal Degeneration reversible? Or will I always be reliant on chiropractor care?

A big issue seems to be that I am missing the curve in my neck. My first chiropractor seemed to think this could be fixed by rolling a towel up under my neck for 20 minutes a day. I tried that for 2 years and the effects never lasted. Is it possible to restore the neck curve permanently?",Stage 1 - Spinal Degeneration. Is it reversible?

Chiropractic,"I have been dealing with shoulder pain for years. After pursuing all other avenues besides surgery, my doctor recommended I try seeing a chiropractor. 

I went in for the first time two days ago. We sat down and discussed my pain and what my treatment plan would be. I was feeling pretty excited by what I was hearing, because it sounded like he could really help me. The chiropractor laid me down on my stomach, and started by adjusting my neck. I was SUPER taken aback -- like I said I've never had this done before and the movement was so sudden and aggressive it kind of shocked me. I was surprised it didn't break my neck lol, the cracking was LOUD. It really freaked me out. I am really sensitive and I am not the type of person who is used to cracking my back or neck or even my knuckles. It is not a sensation I enjoy.

After that he did a few more things to my back and shoulder. Then I was taken into a different room for some electrical stimulation therapy. As I was walking to the next room, I felt fine, just a bit unsettled by the neck adjustment still. I was in the new room for about five minutes, then an assistant came to set me up for the electrical stimulation. As she was setting me up, I started to get extremely lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseous. My vision and hearing started blacking out and I felt like I was about to faint (which has never ever in my life happened to before). We stopped, she got me some water, opened the windows, and I laid down for a few minutes. I think if I had stayed standing for even 30 seconds longer, I probably would've passed out. The chiropractor came in to make sure I was okay. He said that although it is rare, people sometimes have this kind of reaction to a large adjustment and he promised it would never happen to me again. TBH though...he seemed a little freaked out and taken aback by my reaction.

Now it's two days later and my neck and back feel quite sore. Not painful, but definitely a weird feeling that hasn't passed. I'm supposed to go back tonight but I am honestly feeling really nervous and kind of skeptical. I am definitely going to at least show up and discuss my concerns and how I am feeling with him, but I am afraid to let him adjust my neck again.

Should I trust him that this kind of reaction was nothing to worry about?",Almost fainted after first adjustment...should I be concerned to go back?

I had a dissectomy for a bulging disc a few years ago but this seems vastly different.

I've also had reoccurring hemorrhoids. Had a banding surgery and going in for another. Also diagnosed with general anxiety. Male aged 37.

I'm in physio therapy who has me doing stretch/band around my knee exercises to activate my pelvic floor.

It's very on/off. Riding my motorcycle, my absolute #1 love and hobby, makes it pretty bad for days. Sitting can hurt or walking, but not guaranteed triggers. Bowel movements seem to affect things for sure.

In particular today I noticed that if I relax my spinchter (or whatever it is you call the muscle group that I hold my poo with) and press on the bottom of my coccyx, it causes intense sharp pain. Tighten up, and it's like it's not there. It's the same spot I rub after motorcycle rides.

Chiropractic,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for advice. 

I started seeing a chiropractor in 2020 right before the pandemic due to an injury but I stopped going to that particular office after the pandemic started. I was/still am new to the chiropractic field as a patient but I compared some of the experiences I had there to posts on this sub and decided to stop going to that office. I had relief from the initial injury right away but they were engaging in really intense marketing regarding immunity and there were billing red flags I won't get into too much because that is not the point of this post - suffice to say I stopped going. 

Essentially, fast forward two years to now. I have been having more issues with my lifestyle aggravating the injury and I went to a new chiropractor last week who I have a much better vibe with. I'm actually really excited to continue going there!  

Before the appointment last week I reached out via my old chiro's website and essentially put in a ticket requesting to get a copy of my old xrays in preparation for my appointment. They never responded. So today I called directly and spoke with their receptionist moments ago. All I said is that I'm a former patient and that I'd like a copy of my xrays. She was very good natured in her response, she said that she'd be happy to get my xrays for me but they are the property of the chiropractor's office and that I could check them out any time that I'd like for 10 days at a time. To which I said, that's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. So at this time she took my phone number and said she'd call me back when I can come check out the xrays.   


I don't work in health care but for my job I am required to complete the same HIPPA training every year so I know I have a right to my data. Even my new chiro reiterated this briefly when I met him and told him that I'd reached out for my old xrays but not heard back - he indicated I should be able to get a dvd or something with them digitally. The receptionist on the phone said that she could not give me a digital copy because they were film. And apparently them being film is the same reason they own my xrays she said. I asked her what happens if I check out my xrays and never return them and she just said something like, ""well, we own them cause they're film"". If I recall correctly, I had to pay like $80 for those xrays at the time but I could be wrong. To me it feels like it's my body, my data, my film, my money my everything. I feel like I should be able to not even have copies but the originals and never return them and do whatever I want cause it's all mine. 

So my realm of questioning for you all centers around these xrays and my rights and how I should proceed. Is there a difference between having a right to my data and ""owning"" my data? Should I just ""check out"" the xrays, share them with my new chiro and then return them to the old chiro as they want? Should I check them out and then never return them because I'm petty? What can they do to me if I never return them? You all probably know what questions I should be asking better than me so any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading!","Asked for my xrays, was told they own them and I can ""check them out"""

Chiropractic,"I don’t know how common this is, but the chiropractor I went to did both pre and post adjustment X-rays, so that’s what they did.

Chiropractic,"I’ve been seeing a chiropractor for the past couple months for a herniated disc. Exactly a year ago, I was in similar levels of excruciating pain but never got it checked out. I suspect it was also a herniated disc.

My chiropractor has been giving me spinal decompression treatments (both manual and machine). They really helped at the beginning but I feel like I’ve stopped improving.

Chiropractic,"One of my favorite things to teach chiropractors is ion channels and how clinically relevant they can be. I think the lesson creates some ""a-ha"" moments for a lot of us, too. I know it did for me years ago when I learned this. Areas of injured nerves can result in the formation of AIGS (Abnormal Impulse Generating Sites) where impulses start to generate in parts of the axon that normally wouldn't generate impulses. These occur because injuries to nerve cells alters their gene expression and this causes ion channels (as well as the type of ion channel... different types respond to different stimuli) to accumulate and form in the injured area. 

Ion channels have to set up shop where there is no myelin, so this occurs in the DRG (which is already insanely sensitive), areas of thinned myelin and areas of demyelination. Injured nerves have alterations in axoplasmic flow, too, and that helps this process along. Different types of ion channels respond to different kinds of stimuli, so some AIGS may be sensitive to repetitive movements while others are sensitive to sustained positioning. Others may be sensitive to thermal changes (which I think explains why some people feel worse pain in cold weather). Emotions can set AIGS off because adrenaline and noradrenaline can open some types of ion channels.

AIGS fire impulses toward the spine and also toward the periphery. The signals that fire peripherally cause release of pro-inflammatory chemicals into their target tissues, which is called neurogenic inflammation, a type of inflammation that is generally unresponsive to medications. I think this can  also explain some of those cases where people report pain that seems to start distally and move proximally, opposite of what most of us were taught occurs in irritated nerves. 

Hopefully this gives you some better appreciation of the humble ion channel!",Did you know ion channels are actually cool?

I’m just after a second opinion if someone could please give me one, il give you the my history.

Around October 2017 I was doing rack pulls in the gym and jarred my back. The next morning I had sciatica symptoms from my bum all the way down to my foot. I went to the chiropractor and within a few sessions I was fine.

In March 2020 again I was in the gym doing Romanian deadlifts and I jarred my back, this time was awful and I couldn’t get out of bed for days l, again I went to chiropractors, osteopathic clinics acupuncture but nothing worked.

I went to physio but it didn’t help then 3 weeks ago I went to another chiropractor. 
He told me that my joints have seized up and that I need to release them. So I went in for the first week 3 times, the pain went from sitting to being in pain lying down. He suggested that I started to go 5 times a week and that we do a 2 man lift on my back to loosen it but the pain has now increased to having it all the time(standing, sitting lying down).
I’ve done 11 sessions in 3 weeks and am just wondering if it is jammed up or am I suffering from a herniated disc?

Chiropractic,"Hello all

I went to a chiro recently for headache, head pressure, neck pain, back pain, tingling on my left foot.

I went the first time and he made some adjustments with an activator and some atlas orthogonal. Then I saw him again two days later and also had a physio session, also prescribed by him, but done by a PT.

I had actually been feeling a bit better before I saw him the first time and up to the day I did. The day after the first adjustment I was very sore, and the day after that all my problems came back. Second session was yesterday and I'm feeling better but still worse than before I started. Actually, arguably he and/or the PT set me back since the food tingling is worse than when I started! 

He wants me to keep seeing him twice a week and probably do 8-10 more adjustments, all with PT attached to it. This is around 300 USD per instance... I understand some feel worse before better but after two sessions I'm actually feeling worse than when I started seeing him. He so said it would take two weeks or so (that's over a thousand dollars there, thanks) 

Does the above sound normal? If you ask me I'm worse than when I started seeing him and I'm inclined to instead go see an orthopedist, which my insurance will actually cover! 

This guy is supposed to be amazing and has beyond great reviews, but I'm starting to wonder if he's just really good at marketing instead.

Any similar experiences?

Chiropractic,"I just saw a new chiropractor after moving to a new city and not being seen by another for 4 years. I have chronic lower back pain, some shoulder pain, and hip pain. I am 30 years old. 

I had x-rays and testing done and he adjusted me the first visit. Second visit he adjusted me, did e-stim, some rehab exercises. He then showed me a potential 3 month plan. 3x/week for 1 month, test, 2x/week for 1 month, test, and then 1x/week for 1 month and test. The tests seemed likely not evidence based - It was some sort of thermal (automatic nervous system) test, a spinal test, and one other. He stated that this is just an outline, we can change anything I’d like, if I feel better we can lessen my time, make changes as we go, etc. however, getting this testing done so many times seems like overkill, especially when insurance will not cover more than 1 test and only about half of these potential sessions.

From what I have been reading elsewhere, the whole 3 month plan seems sketchy. But after 2 sessions My pain has minimized greatly! He is open to my feedback and wants, seems focused on long-term changes and functional changes like posture/sleep, etc. has great reviews too. 

I just feel like I’m getting mixed signals. Any help would be appreciated.",My chiropractor wants me to get testing done 1x/month at 100$ a piece for 3 months ?

Chiropractic,"I get emails from a few of them and I'm interested to see what they are about. I don't like high pressure sales and I won't do anything close to unethical. I don't need to have my thetons measured or anything. But my practice could certainly be busier and having someone to coach me might help me not make expensive mistakes (I made two of those this year, and I'm still climbing my way out form under them).

If you have had a good experience, what made it good? What was the fee structure? What did you get from it that you couldn't get on your own? If you have had a bad experience, what made it bad?",Does anyone have a good experience with a practice coach.

Chiropractic,"Hello.

I'm a new patient who has been receiving chiropractic care for hip pain (two appointments so far spaced two weeks apart). I saw my chiropractor two weekends ago, and then again this past weekend. My chiropractor diagnosed me with hip impingement, and said that my hip flexors are extremely tight, and she wants to loosen them up first and foremost before she can give me physio exercises.

During both appointments, my chiropractor did a painful massage of my hip flexor/groin area, where she put her fingers in the hip joint area, and had me straighten and bend my leg.

She also advised that I try to heat my groin and hip area as often as possible with heating pads or hot baths. I am also supposed to not bend my hip at more than a 90 degree angle.

After my first appointment with her two weekends ago, my hip flexors were in more pain than I was in before I saw her, which subsided after a few days.

After my appointment with her three days ago, my hips flexors/groin area has been in more pain than they have ever been before and the pain does not seem to be subsiding. I have tried to stretch them, but even with the most gentle hip flexor stretches the pain seems to be aggravated even more. I'm very concerned about the amount of pain my hips flexors/groin is in.

Right now I feel there is nothing I can do to stretch or help with the hip pain. I have tried all the heating and hot baths, and have not been sitting at all (only laying down horizontally or standing at my desk), and have not done any of my usual exercises for fear of aggravating the pain more with bending or stretching. (I have only been doing some bridges which I do every morning and evening anyway).

My questions are: Is it possible my chiro hurt my hip flexor muscles or did something to bruise them or make the pain worse? Should I keep up with the hot baths and pads or is it possible that the heat is making the pain worse? Should I try to stretch my hip flexors through the pain or should I only rest them? Should I cancel my appointment with the chiro and seek a different practitioner? Help!

(Note: I have already contacted my doctor to request a referral to a sports doctor and imaging on my hips to confirm the impingement. Given the amount of pain I'm in, I am pursuing medical assistance, however, I am not sure how long the waitlist with the sports doctor is going to be, and in the meantime I am not sure if I should continue working with this particular chiropractor)",Patient question: Lots of pain after Chiropractor appointment.

Chiropractic,,"Not just a thorn in my side anymore, should I seek care after a fall?"
Chiropractic,"took a pretty hard fall a week or so ago. Fell with my left elbow sort of tucked into my left side on my ribs. It hurt a lot when it happened but I tried to walk it off. A few days later pain on my lower left rib, wrapping around my back started to get worse. I'm struggling to do basic housework as any upper body movement seems to aggravate it and hurts like hell. Focusing on icing and practicing deep breathing. Ribs do look different but I know that's normal. However, my left one has a gap that looks odd IMO and I'm unsure on whether I should seek some chiropractic care/advice. On a scale of 1 to 10 I say pain gets to a 7 when it's aggravated.",Not just a thorn in my side anymore?

I got a device online called a neck sling that hangs from a door nob and puts traction on my cervical  spine. I feel a hurt in a good way type of pain when doing it.

Chiropractic,,"ELI5: What actually happens when a chiropractor 'cracks your back'? What are they doing, what makes the noise, and why do we feel different afterwards?"
Chiropractic,"Hi, I hope I'm in the right group.   


I was in a car accident and chipped a small piece off T7 and compressed from T6-8. I was lucky no spinal or brain damage. I was told to lie down for 8 weeks. I'm fine, altho my back does hurt a little during certain movements. The chip has calcified  in place and apparently doesn't pose a danger of ever falling off. Fingers crossed!  


The doctor as well as the physical therapists said that my compression will be there forever, that the space will be filled up eventually by bone, and that I need to do daily back exercises forever so that my back muscles stay strong and I don't develop scoliosis. As long as I have near-perfect mobility in the coming months I don't really care if I'm a tiny bit shorter, but the idea that I can never decompress my spine seems suspect to me.  


I'm in a foreign country where I don't speak the language and so it's a challenge to really get all my questions answered. I'm not looking for medical advice or a diagnosis, I just want different opinions from outside this country.

Chiropractic,,Just a little therapy from my chiro
Chiropractic,"Hello,

6 year in practice chiro (diversified, art, sports  practitioner) I've started working at a very high end, high price point clinic, multi-disciplinary clinic.  I've been met with many skeptical and (relatively) difficult patients on my caseload, many of these patients are new to chiropractic.  Patients are presenting with such daily requests and expectations:

  
\- expectations range from 'fix me' in one to two sessions (think acute on chronic presentations ie spinal stenosis, cervical radiculopathy, labral tears, facet irritation):  
\-wanting a massage, physiotherapy, and chiropractic approach all in one  
\-requesting orthopedic exam write outs  
\-requesting write-ups and letters to their MD often  
\-wanting me to call their physios and MD's to ""okay"" chiropractic treatment   
\-want multiple imaging reports read on the spot  
\-wanting full sports training and rehabilitation programs designed and executed and integrated into treatment (ie ACL rehab)  
\-asking repeatedly for me to 'go check' with other practitioners to make treatment plans congruent   
\-asking me to change my technique to match their retired chiropractor's style and delivering perfect full spine adjustments every time (I try!)    


The list goes on.  I'm getting exhausted and burn out very quickly.  Patient retention and compliance is at its lowest in my career.   I love working with patients, I love explaining why their problems are re-occurring, I explain how to move better, which active exercises to do,  and how assist my chiro care at home. I set realistic expectations with patients.   I spend 45 min on initials and do a very thorough exam, 20min follow ups.  I treat dependent upon patients needs and only do maintenance care if  needed, but it is encouraged.  

Is it me or the clinic?  Any words of wisdom from a different POV is appreciated.  Constructive criticism is most welcome !  Thank you",Patient management
