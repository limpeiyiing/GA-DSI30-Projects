Chiropractic,"I’m pretty frustrated and I’m trying to get some clarity on an issue.

I have a Medicare patient from New Jersey (I am not in NJ) who has Horizon Blue/BCBS of New Jersey as her supplemental insurance. After submitting claims, Horizon sends me payment in the form of a virtual credit card. These credit cards are a scam. They want you to manually enter the credit card and amount on your point of sale terminal. This type of transaction has very high processing fees, up to 5%. The credit card issuer also kicks make a portion of this processing fee back to the payer.

The Affordable Care Act addresses this issue and requires payers to make EFT payments if the provider refuses the virtual card.

However, so far it seems like the EFT enrollment process for Horizon seems to be a sham. Even though they claim they offer this, there is no actual way to enroll. Every time you call they give you a different set of instructions for enrolling. First, they claim you must enroll as a participating provider. While I am in network in BCBS, I am not a provider for a regional plan in another part of the country. You are not required to enroll as a provider for supplemental insurance. Second, even after completing their lengthy list of documents required (Tax ID, NPI, address, statement on office letter head with your intent to join the network, subscribe to NaviNet, W-2 form, and more) they claim to wait 30 days for approval. I finished these tasks in October, then again in December after being told they have none of my information in their system. Even now when I call and after giving them my confirmation number, they still claim like they’ve never heard of me before. They just keep telling me to wait or try resubmitting again.

I can’t tell if this is incompetence or intentional obfuscation. Has anyone else been through this process? Help! What can I do? I’m about to file a complaint with the state.",Question for insurance chiros who have treated patients with Horizon Blue/BCBSNJ supplemental insurance
Chiropractic,"Hello all, 

I got whiplash at the beginning of the year and decided to go see a chiropractor. I did go see my primary physician and she diagnosed me with whiplash and recommended PT as well. I went to see a chiropractor because I've had success before - I had a concussion a few years ago and a chiropractor helped me get mobile again (less neck pain and headaches.) 

So, the first few chiropractic appointments were uneventful. He didn't really do manipulations as he wanted the neck inflammation to go down before he attempted anything. He did review what symptoms I had and what plan of action he would do. 

I did receive sports massages and waited on PT. I eventually made it to my 9th appt (which would be the third appt where he would try some manipulations as he done very gentle ones before.) I also told him that my back pain was getting worse and he suggested to try to help there too. 

The neck adjustment was harsher than the one before, and he quickly moved my head to the left and then to the right. I felt a pop but didn't really feel any pain. I do admit I was tense when he did the adjustment as I wasn't prepared for the kind of force used. Then he had me lie on my back and cracked my back on both sides by placing one leg over the other one and pressing down. 

This seemed to help my back pain and I was fine leaving. On the way home, I noticed my neck felt strained (similar to when I had whiplash symptoms appear) and took some ibuprofen. I went to see him back the next day as the pain had gotten worse. He tried adjusting my neck again but didn't really do anything that caused popping. 

Now, it's been 3 days since the original adjustment. I have burning back pain and my neck pain has gotten better but I am still sore and in pain. I did go see my primary care physician and she thinks he may have aggravated my muscles which also aggravated my nerves, leading to the pain I've been having.  I don't have any dizziness but did notice nausea two days after the original adjustment. 

Honestly, I never want to go back to the chiropractor. He does have great reviews and I know a few people who have gone to him and rave about him. Honestly, I don't know what to do now. I keep hearing the horror stories of strokes weeks after an adjustment and I'm really worried this might happen to me.

Chiropractic,"Hi, I’m [24F] and have just recently went to the chiropractor and now I might have back surgery. 

This started at the beginning of the year, I got Covid and, well, had a really tough time with it. I also kept the nasty cough after getting over Covid. About a day or two after getting over the sickness my back started to hurt really bad. It felt like standing up I needed to almost pop back into place before being able to walk. I finally found a Chiropractor and went to him. The pain extended from the bottom of my spine to my hip. He fixed my hip issue but didn’t touch my spine. I was still  in some pain and when I told him about the spine part he told me that it was a mental thing and I would start to feel better by next week. I don’t know about bones like he does so I took his word for it and by the time next week came and I was still in pain I tried to make another appointment but he was gone on vacation. All while going through this I was starting my new job as a barista. Sort of labor intensive at the shop I work at so I figured I needed to get my back fixed before it got worse so I found a walk-in chiropractor that had 4.8 stars. 

Looking back now I really regret going. 

I went and told them the issue was in my spine and they seemed to fix it, or so I thought. Later that same day my hip started to hurt again but more than last time, my back pain was subsided though. I went back a few more times and every visit it worsened. Eventually I left there with a leg that was numb from my knee down and a hip that was excruciatingly painful to walk on. (Side note, he used a massager on my hip and leg and actually left bruising from how hard he pushed.) I decided I needed to see a different kind of Chiropractor, one that was more gentle and did just that. By this time I was in so much pain that I was crying to walk and standing for a longer time than 5 minutes made me dizzy. When I went to the other chiropractor he told me that he wouldn’t adjust me at the time because my back and leg muscles were so inflamed that he couldn’t tell what my issue was but he was afraid it was a disc injury. He told me that if my numbness gets any worse to go to the ER. That weekend, Super Bowl Sunday actually, I ended up taking an ER trip because I couldn’t move my toes and any sort of pressure on my leg was unbearable. They did a few tests and found out that I have 4 herniated discs in my back that are pinching off my Sciatica nerve which is causing the numbness. I now am on steroids and will have to get more injected into my back and if that doesn’t work then I have no other choice but to undergo back surgery. I’ve had other bad experiences with past chiropractors and so I didn’t realize how bad it truly was until the ER visit. I don’t want to assume that that Chiropractor is the reason for the herniated discs because I originally went for my back and hip but it wasn’t nearly this bad until after him. 

TL;DR : I went to a walk-in chiropractor for my back issue and now I have four herniated discs and potentially will need to get surgery to fix it.",I don’t know if it’s the Chiropractor’s fault or not?

Chiropractic,"Hello everyone,

Ever since I was in middle school (14 years ago basically), I have been having a constant feeling of a pinched nerve on the left side of my body only. From my fingertips to my toes, I have muscle weakness, a pulling sensation, occasional numbness, and let's say I try to raise both legs up in the air, the right leg feels zero pain but the pulling sensation on the left leg becomes immensely too much. This applies to my left arm vs right arm as well. I thought I was born with this and it was something that cannot be fixed, however, apparently there can be a/some pinched nerve(s) concerned or perhaps something else. I got an MRI and the doctor couldn't find anything but the sensation is killing me. Do you guys recommend any other means of medical examinations or tests such as EMG and is there anything you are suspicious of given my symptoms? Like I said, it is only on the left side of my body, and the right side is 100% fine.

Thanks beforehand! ❤️",Is it a pinched nerve case or something else?
Chiropractic,"So, i said that my back pain was gone when I started doing leg rises, and low intensity exercice. I said that the majority of back pain can be prevented by doing a bit of lower abs works and being more active, sitting less.
Then, chiro started to tell there is no proof that specific exercise can help back pain, and that every exercice in general, just help. 
I said that it seems a bit moronic to say that every exercise have the same impact on back pain. I mean, tennis, or gardening, isn't the same as working out in the gym where every muscles works in symmetry. For example.
After that, they called me moron, that I have zero proof of anything, and one of them even blocked me. 
I just said that it works for me, and I'm not the only one. Before I included leg rises, even walking was painful, so it's a proof that for me, unspecific exercise alone can't have the same effect on back pain than specific one.

Chiropractic,"Alright, so here's my background.

I've been having upper back pain and slight neck pain since April 2021, my upper back (C7, T1, T2) started cracking whenever I'd straighten my back while sitting at the desk. Things went up and down, and in December 2021 I've decided to try chiropractic because I started having more pain near my cervical area.

I have a pretty straight spine (not really military neck). Before the adjustment I remember also having a migraine after showering with cold water.

Anyway, I went to the chiropractor before Christmas (here in Romania), I'm not sure if the guy was 100% certified, but he's seen lots of people, so I assumed he was ok. During the adjustment he did 3 types of neck adjustments:

\- while I was on my back, cracked my neck twice on each side.

\- while on my belly, chin on table, cracked my neck twice on each side

\- pulled my feet while my head was down in the whole of the table

Long story short, I've had neck pain and upper back pain more than before after this adjustment for almost a month or so. Even episodes of headaches with the neck pain.

Now my neck cracks, pops, grinds, all day long is certain positions and I can hear it in my ears... I'm not sure I had those before, but I'm driving myself nuts. I keep hearing those cracks without intentionally wanting to crack my neck, like something's snapping or grinding over there (bone to bone?).

Chiropractic,"""An interesting dichotomy I am noticing amongst EB Chiros. 

As associates, the compensation is a big factor, concern, and conversation, as it should be. 

But when they become a practice owner they don't want to talk about money and profits. They want to only ""serve"" the patient. Afraid to admit they want to be handsomely profitable too. 

Oftentimes, assuming those who are ""killing it"" must be doing something shady or providing worse care than you.  

Being a great patient-centered doctor and wanting to be compensated very well for it isn't mutually exclusive. 

What are you doing to provide great care, patient experience, healthy revenue, and a great profit margin? The math can add up. But it will take vision, strategy, conviction, and consistency.

I went back the next day and he’s selling me a 3 month plan to contain my scoliosis. My understanding is this plan wouldn’t include actually correcting it but just the containment - correction could be a very extended process. The plan is 3 times a week for 3 months. Today was the end of 2 weeks. 

Next week, I plan to ask him how is he measuring the progress, if any. He mentioned that i have functional scoliosis caused by a small difference in my leg lengths. I also want to confirm if this indeed is correct. 

Any thoughts on this will be greatly appreciated. This is my first time ever visiting a chiropractor.",Possible functional scoliosis - need expert opinion on my “treatment plan”

Chiropractic,"I was asked my advice on reaching out to local businesses, and decided to share with everyone! This is particularly good for students or new docs, or if you are just trying to brainstorm some new thoughts.

The size of your practice will be relative to the number of people you know, so when reaching out to other businesses you want to reach as many people as you can. Everybody has a spine, they have employees with spines, and so on. Never prejudge a place!

I made little networking groups. You can join groups like BNIs and RLIs, and by all means do so, but also do this. Get local business owners together for coffee for about 20 minutes. Keep the meeting short and focused, go around and have everyone share what they do and how others can help them. Everyone can exchange cards. I would collect emails and ask if people would like to meet up again in a month or few weeks? I'd email everyone the next date. I also would ask them to invite someone else they think could benefit. 

At one time I had 4 or 5 of these groups going on at the same time. I had mornings, lunches, after work cocktails multiple days a month. Having multiple times makes it easier to invite people. If someone can't make it over lunch, maybe they would be able to do in the morning? Tuesday doesn't work, how about Thursday? (more pots catch more fish). If you are nervous about it, just start with one group.

Here is how I would invite people:

""Hi, I'm Dr K and I was getting some local business owners together to learn about each others' businesses and help each other grow. Would you like to join us?""

Have an idea what you want to say, but don't be scripted with it. If someone says no, that is fine. At the least you put out energy that you were trying to help others, and they'll remember that. I even had a few people ask to come in as patients right then. Some of the groups I had up to 16 people at a time, but others maybe only were 4-6. Even if it is just 1 person showing up, you can still make a connection and relationship. I always started by calling insurance agents, realtors, bankers, photographers. These are people who go to just about every networking thing they can. You can make a choice to include MLM folks, that's up to you. But by calling these professions you generally always guarantee you'll have at least a handful show up.

I would call over and over. The first call is always nervous, but you get into a groove. I would make a goal that I would make 20 calls in a day, or maybe I would go until I get 20 ""no""s. If you have big anxiety on the phone, reward yourself afterwards with Taco Bell for facing your fears.

Another way to reach out to businesses is simply to walk in. I did this in multiple ways, but the best way is to bring something with you. You can get candy, fruit, granola bars, donuts, or whatever you want and bring them in with your card and info. You can even phrase it as neighbor appreciation if you'd like. People are more receptive if you have food, and are willing to hear your 20 second pitch. I try not to take up much of their time unless they start asking questions and are excited. (great time to have your planner with you if someone wants to schedule while you are there). Be friendly and professional--this is their first impression of you as a new patient, just like they walked into your office. If you wanted to provide a new patient special or offer, that is up to you. I did at times and it did bring some people in.

I would also call specific businesses to build a relationship. This would be professions like LMTs or personal trainers, podorthists--people I can refer well with. I invite them to lunch and learn about them, and then work to build a relationship. Doulas are another great one if you want to work with pregnancy, kids, or reach nurses. Also hair stylists. Get as many hair stylists to know about you as possible. You get great results with headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, and wrist issues. Either way, go into these lunches looking to build a relationship. If the mindset is to get new patients, you'll fail. Be interested in the other person, and follow-up after. Not every connection will be a winner, but you'll find people you click with.

Existing patients can also be a resource. This gets into things like lunch n learns or wellness events, but if you can get in contact with an HR person they are a great entryway to helping a company. Some companies have a morale committee or wellness committee. Tell existing patients ""Thank you for letting me take care of you. I bet you have others at your office dealing with the same thing. Do you know who would be a good person to talk to for me to see what I can do to help?"" HR people love when you get prevent sick days, injuries, and improve happiness. A worker who feels good is more efficient.

These are the ways I built relationships with local businesses starting out. Really if you go outside your door and look around, everyone in a 5 mile radius should know about you. It takes a lot of energy, but it pays off. I slept best on days when I went out and gave it everything I had, rather than days where I was lazy and let the fear of being out there win. These are some of the ventures I took to get known. Say yes to all the opportunities you can when starting out!",How I Marketed to Local Businesses

Chiropractic,"There's a lot to cover here... but I'm gonna try to make this short, to the point, and unbias as much as possible. 

A few weeks ago my mom referred me to this family owned Chiropractor Center in the Bay Area. She told me she heard about it from a friend. I decided to want to check it out because I literally have been telling myself I need to go to one. She said they offer x-rays and I haven't had that from my previous chiropractor many years ago, so I was interested to get an actual visual of my neck spine and hips.

The first day I came in, I was the only one wearing a mask. There were about 5 others there sitting on chairs without one. Apparently wearing a mask is optional, which i can somewhat respect to the extent of personal choice. But my mom didn't mention that to me (shes antivax and super Christian), and the doctors NEVER wore theirs (so are they). After being kinda surprised about that I just said nothing, kept my mask on and moved on. 

I filled out forms of symptoms and past medical history etc. The forms took me a little longer than it should've but before I finished, they started a class presentation about the importance of our health, what we eat and how subluxation doesn't allow the body to work at 100% function. Their definition of health is the body working at 100% function. 

Some of the things they taught were that 5/6 people in the US will possibly die of heart attack or cancer, and that the main cause of them is inflammation. What causes inflammation? Sugar. They also talked about the importance of mindful eating and making sure to look at the ingredients of what you buy etc. They even have ""Shop with the Doc"" days where we go with them to whole foods and learn what to look for when shopping.

I believe I learned something new from their presentation. It was very interesting and I agreed to a lot... but then they started playing clips on Fox News and making claims that COVID is a hoax. In this clip they basically talked about how COVID was created in a lab and used as a bioweapon to create fear tactics.

Now while that theory could be a possibility, I'm only going to take that information with a grain of salt just like any other info. Because we're talking about the unknown here. Nobody knows anything 100%. I was skeptical of the vaccine at first but I got it because I live with my grandparents who wanted me to get it. I haven't had any known issues since and never got a positive covid test. Not saying that the vaccine was the #1 reason for that, but who knows. 

Keep in mind that this family owned business is also Christian-based, and my mom is also Christian. I consider myself atheist and passively disagree with her on many things, including covid. COVID doesn't have to be political but unfortunately it is. Anyways, the presentation ends and I go home feeling all weirded out by this somewhat cult like structure.

And then comes the 2nd visit to get xrays done.

3rd visit: Before seeing my results they had another class on how to view my xrays and what to look for. After that I see how bad of shape I am and they explain everything to me. From there, they wanted to see if I wanted to continue with them and to either A.) pay up front with at 10% discount along with a ""referral discount"" and another ""25% family discount"" or B.) to open a credit account through them. And even though I was skeptical I decided to continue with them and pay the up front option with my credit card. This service costed about $2400 for 12 weeks, 3 visits a week. Is that a good price?

The next few visits went pretty well, other than the doctors not wearing masks. They also consistently tell me to take off my mask when i lay down to get an adjustment so that ""i can breathe"". I tell them politely I'll keep it on and don't mind. But other then that The visits and adjustments seemed to be doing at least something to my mood because i do feel a little better. Possibly placebo effect? 

Fast forward to this last Monday. We had a ""Shop with the Docs"" day where we met at Whole Foods and got hands on view of how to read the ingredients and what is the best choices. I show up there and most of the group had masks on except my mom, her friend, and the Doctors....

You guys... they had their masks off the entire time. We were getting eyeballs left and right and eventually they were confronted by a customer. The lady asked the Doctors if they could put their masks on and they responded with ""We're a private group."" The lady said she was disgusted by them and walked away. Then the doctors got bitter and whispered to us that they weren't even standing 6 feet from her and belittling her. 

Absolutely ridiculous. That act right there kinda showed me what kind of people these doctors are: entitled as hell. Preaching to us in a cult like fashion how health is important but don't have any consideration for others... it's literally just a mask. What kind of point are they trying to prove by not wearing one? That their way of thinking is the correct way. This just my initial feeling and I still feel this way.

I had another visit today and the docs still mention to take off the mask when i lay down.. and that in the last 2 years of doing what they do they've only had 2 patients have symptoms. And that masks don't work... if they don't work then why were surgeons wearing them before the pandemic? 

I'm not really sure what to do. I have a hard time saying no to people, so I'm still going to them because my mom referred me and also the fact that I do feel good after. But even though I feel good, I become anxious to go home and be around my grandparents. I haven't told them that this place doesn't wear masks either because then it would really upset them so i just stay locked in my room.

If I decide to opt out ""I will have to pay a $200 nonrefundable fee and will not be charged for future visits and if prepaid a refund will be issued and processed within 6 weeks.""

Part of me tells me to run towards fear and stay with them and see how things go but I'm not sure if this the right context for it...

What are your thoughts? Should I stay or are there much better options out there?",Been feeling kinda skeptical of this chiropractor center... They claim that COVID is a hoax?

Chiropractic,"Just thought I'd get some input.
I have a 40-year-old male complaining of difficulty focusing, minor neck pain, has had 2 episodes where his legs went stiff for a couple of hours, also history of numbness where the C5 &amp; 6 dermatomes are(which went off). Onset was approximately 7 years ago, initially saw a neurologist that ordered a brain MRI that revealed nothing, sent him on his way out with xanax which did nothing to help. A year later, he went to a community clinic where the attending physician attributed his symptoms to hypertension, he was given Amlodipine which made him feel faint and well.. hypotensive (BP was high during initial exam, but was normal after the first visit. I'm attributing the high BP due to pain and health related anxiety). A year after, he saw another doc at the same clinic and told him he had fibromyalgia and it was fibro fog but nothing was done (No tender spots anywhere near the neck surprisingly). The year after that, his legs went stiff when he was shopping, was brought to a hospital, they did a cervical MRI which revealed C3/4/5/6 central and posteriolateral bulges. Put him on traction which resolved pretty much the eyesight, and numbness. 

He was recommended to come in the office by his doctor, physical exam revealed nothing except for loss of ROM and pain on extension which the manips helped with (full active pain free range). Started him on light rehab on the second visit, some extension self mob with a band and chin tucks.

Chiropractic,"I've been seeing a chiropractor for 4 months now. I was going 3x a week to begin with and am now going once a week.

I only feel good immediately after the adjustment. The next day, my neck reverts back to feeling tense and makes ""bubbly"" noises/feelings when I rotate my neck and head (neck crepitus? idk). The next day I feel desperate to go see her/chiro again. The issue is that I've NEVER had this bubbly feeling/noises before. Not until seeing this chiropractor.
