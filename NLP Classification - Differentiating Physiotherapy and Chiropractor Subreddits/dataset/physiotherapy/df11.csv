physiotherapy,[deleted],developing an intense crush on my physiotherapist.
physiotherapy,"I broke my leg at 15, and was fully healed by 16 - where I was in a cast for 6 months &amp; then had surgery (metal rod) and on crutches for 3 months. From 16 I was given physio exercises to rejuvenate my ankle and calf until I was back on my feet. I was told to continue them if I was to get back into sport but my lazy and unmotivated young self wasn‚Äôt for it.

I did go back into sports, didn‚Äôt play competitive again until 19.

In between this time and til now, I still have a limp. I believe it‚Äôs to do with my Achilles‚Äô Tendon and/or Heel. It‚Äôs tight, so my motion isn‚Äôt full and proper.

Is it possible for me to regain motion through stretches? I‚Äôve found 3 stretches, involving a wall &amp; staircase - Im planning to do this 3 times everyday for a month.

physiotherapy,"Hey guys

I'm 1 year into my career as an MSK physio and I find myself struggling lately.

I joined a private practice after graduating from university. It's a small but good team of 5 physios. I made my way through my first year with lots of learning. I felt I was finally getting good at my job, but the last month just seemed to absolutely crush me.

I had a lot of new clients in the last month who do not rebook or return for their follow-up appointments. Granted, a few of these patients presented with very simple issues like minor muscle tightness/soreness that did not need any long term care. However, there are many other of my patients who do not return after 1-2 visits when their conditions clearly need continued treatments to improve. I don't want to assume anything, but I suspect that most of their pain/symptoms are probably not 100% better given the way they presented to the clinic.

As part of our policy, we recall each patient that cancels or doesn't rebook out of courtesy. Out of the patients I managed to contact, some of them report that their pain was a bit better, but not much. Others say that the treatment hasn't had much of an effect. The final nail in the coffin is when i received an email from a client this morning saying that he/she decided not to return to physiotherapy because it flared up his/her symptoms.

I am in absolute disarray right now because my confidence in my own skills are in pieces. I don't know whether it's because I've become complacent (I don't think I have, but who am I to judge myself), or if it's a series of coincidences. I don't even know where to start to re-evaluate myself right now. It seems that in the past year, I was able to help most of my clients to get better within the first 2 sessions, and they return either for self-management/home exercise strategies, or to have their other pains/conditions looked at. But right now, I'm losing patients left and right and I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong.

Has anyone else experienced this before? If so, what did you do to overcome this? I really need some help and advice at this stage. Thanks!",1 year in and I need help

physiotherapy,"Hi all,

  Hope everyone is coping well!

  I am from Singapore and would most likely be starting the UQ Master of Physiotherapy studies program in 2022.

  Have a few questions with regards to this.

1. How is the graduate employability prospects for this program? Have always heard that UQ is one of the best physiotherapy schools. Is it hard to get jobs at public hospitals? 
2. Understand the tuition is quite expensive for international students. Does the workload of the program allow students to work part-time?
3. Anyone moved on to pursue a PhD after this program? Will like to ask more questions specific to this seperately.

What do you think about the lecturers and resources at University of Queensland? All physiotherapy lectures are currently online with some pracs at uni due to COVID? What do you think about the qualities of the online courses? Is it difficult to understand? As an international student, I possibly can‚Äôt attend the pracs at uni due to COVID as I can‚Äôt enter Australia at the moment. However, learning physiotherapy requires lots of hands-on experience which I really worry that online lectures possibly can't provide.

I heard UQ can possibly help the international students to apply for travel exemption right before the placement around next year in July to enter Australia. Do you know any international students facing similar problems and how they cope with it? 

I heard that the fail rates of courses and placement are relatively high in Australia, is it true? If I fail the course or placement, will I have a second chance to retake it or do I need to defer for one year?

Actually, I've also got an offer to study master of physiotherapy from Keele University in UK but the ranking seems to be lower than that of UQ.

When I asked them to show me a single leg RDL for a mid -stage hamstring patient, they could not show me a competent one, at least one good enough to be an example for the patient.

physiotherapy,"Hello, Redditors!

3 years ago, I jumped off of a rock, wasn't that high, but lo and behold, being over 40 and possibly not Superman, I damaged both knees.  I did eventually get an MRI, and they confirmed that I had chondrosis/fissures in my cartilage in weight bearing areas.  Pre-arthritis is what the sports physio called it.  I was unlucky, I guess.  I did have a good 1.5 years of pretty intense pain and general tightness, and a little bit of patello-femoral syndrome, but that's slowly gone down.  Ligments all seemed to check out with physios.

Over the course of 2 years, I went to several physios, and they all went pretty hard with the idea of targeted exercises.  Bands.  Squats.  Leg lifts.  Though, the last physio simply said ""don't run"", and recommended getting Synvisc One injections, so I could tolerate exercise, which is my biggest issue.  I can't realistically rehab my knees, if I can only sleep 2 hours a night for weeks on end.

I have recently begun cycling VERY carefully, using an e-bike, so I could pedal off and on, and add some strengthening that way.  I can't even carry more than possibly 30 pounds, especially upstairs.

Should I try physio again?  Injections?  Just wait and see?  My knees ARE better than 3 years ago, I can walk/hike for hours, but I can't help but feel that this is too slow, and I'm pretty limited.  I don't expect to run ever again, I'm just trying to be realistic, and may shoot for being able to cycle and carry laundry up and down the stairs :)

On a personal note, every time I go to physios, I find they want to ""test my abilities"" and range, and manuipulate, etc, which invariably hurts me for days afterward.  I find it kills my self-esteem, as they tend to be bewildered that I ""can't do this"" or that, and that I ""should"" be able to.  One even said ""you just need to gain more confidence in moving your body"".  I also have scoliosis and a permanent groin injury that limits me as well, so I just end up feeling like shit about myself.  Advice would be so welcome!",Knee cartilage injury and physio options?

I have bachelor's degree in physiotherapy. But I have done many courses, read many books, follow research, etc. I have been in this line of work for 15 years. I work privately. 

I wanted to finish some Master's degree abroad, in UK with distant learning to be more specific, but that idea died today. Yes Master's is expensive, it takes time, and I was willing to go that route. But something happened and I do not see the value in that anymore like I used to. I wanted it because of academic title, CV, and when I organize courses so people would respect me more. 

But what popped that bubble is that my work will not change at all, and since I am fully formed clinician I really doubt I would learn something new there that I do not already know or could not learn by myself. I am not taking here in a count writing systematic reviews and being good at academic tasks. I speak 100% practice wise.

physiotherapy,"I'm applying for MSc Pre-Reg Physiotherapy and I'm already trying to plan out the best way to physically study and work. I think that an iPad + apple pencil would be ideal for note taking and annotating slides etc etc. They have a heck of a lot of functionality and advantages over paper notes and it would be perfect for my personal studying methods. 

My question is, would I be able to continue using the ipad while on placements, i.e. are there any privacy/data protection issues I should be aware of? I had read somewhere about patient notes etc not being allowed on cloud storage due to US HIPAA, which makes perfect sense, but I would imagine that there are specific apps or web programs that are more appropriate for healthcare providers. I'm obviously happy to use paper when needed, but I'd like to keep as much of my work digital as possible in order to stay organised and to be able to keep a large volume of files and information close at hand.

physiotherapy,"I have a master degree in physiotherapy, I have 2 years working experience, during university studies I was practicing at a lot of different clinics. I finished my bachelor studies at a well known university in Prague. Now I am based in the capital of Slovakia - Bratislava and I wonder how low physiotherapists get paid here. It is usually around 5 to 6,5eur per hour (making it 800-1100eur per month) and it is hard to compete on this market since the clinica always find someone who does not mind and work for that money.

I have already succeeded at 2 interviews where I got offered almost double the usualy salary in the 1st one and a double the usual salary at the second one. First one is part time and I am currently employed here and the 2nd one was full time but I did not really like the working environment so I rejected this offer. 

Apart from these 2 offers, I was struggling to find anything else paid above 5eur per hour as the reason  always was that clinics can not afford to pay this amount of money to their physiotherapists. The clinics were always happy to hire me but they seemed quite frustrated that they can not pay me more than the mentioned 5eur/hour.

Do you think there's any way to get from the clinics that say they can not afford to pay physios more than 5eur/hour to actually make it? Prices of these clinkcs for 1 hour of physiotherapy varies from 30eur to 50eur.

physiotherapy,"I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôve been jumping careers a lot, and I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve always wanted to be a physiotherapist, I think it‚Äôs where my passion lies in helping people and I‚Äôm very interested in sports science, I also believe it‚Äôs a very strong career to be in and think I would enjoy it.


Bit of information, I‚Äôve been a personal trainer and completed a business level 3 qualification.


The problem is, I‚Äôm not hugely academic, I never went to college or even thought about university but it‚Äôs an option i would consider (if it isn‚Äôt too late) I did get double science and sports GCSE‚Äôs and obviously have my level 3 in sports coaching and personal training, and I have my maths and English.


I‚Äôve been jumping from business to business (9-5 desk jobs) for the last 4 years and none of it is doing it for me or interesting me.


So really, my questions are; is it too late being 23 years old? Is there any non-academic pathway? (On the job training, apprenticeship, fast track courses) or does it have to be university? And lastly, is it worth it? And worth the possible hassle I might have to go through to get there?","I‚Äôve always wanted to become a physiotherapist as I have a nack for sports science but always put off further education (23, U.K.)"
physiotherapy,"Hello, 

I am fully aware no medical advice.

Although could you all give your input here. 

I attended my first session today after a months wait, this was for a knee injury resulting from a endurance bike ride spanning over 350 miles. 

The therapist was kind and attentive, although the appointment was rushed (30 mins for full price of ¬£45 due to Covid) with lots of idle chat regarding her daughters horse riding and sailing endeavours. 

Now this is fine but I've been left feeling rather disappointed, especially for my ""homework"" as it was called, I was handed a quickly drawn sketch and instruction on a piece of paper, with what I think is quite technical wording for what I need to do to ""get better"" until I return three weeks from now.
