Chiropractic,"So yesterday afternoon I had my first adjustment ever. The chiropractor took an X-ray and found the issues that were going on (main complaint has been middle back numbness). He did a few adjustments and said that was enough for the day and to come back Saturday.
Sleeping last night was rough bc my back started to hurt pretty significantly. He did give me an ice pack saying to ice my middle back especially to help with any pain. But seems to be my full back this morning that hurts, though especially my mid-upper back where I have a sharp pain every so often in a certain spot. 
Is this normal or should this pain have dissipated already? I do know that I was probably tense when he was doing the adjustments (there was one time he said to relax my head and he tried a certain adjustment again). Wondering if this could be why I’m in pain… or is it normal for a first adjustment ever for a person who works an office job with terrible posture lol.",Super sore day after first adjustment… could being tense during adjustment cause this?

Chiropractic,"Im in need for advice!! 
I’m a Canadian student who has just visited both SCU and life west and I am stuck between which one to attend. I loved the life west campus and the quarterly semesters. However I like the area more for SCU.

Life west tuition is about 30k cheaper then SCU and I will have a few friends going to life west with a car however each of them are grabbing their own place. In SCU I will be able to do my preceptorship for an entire year back home in Canada, with life west allowing around 4-12 Months. 

Life west also starts in October compared to September for SCU. Life west would be 3.5 years on the 14 quarter calendar or 3 years and 3 months for 12 quarter depending on the C-cat while SCU is 3 years and 4 months for the 10 term track.  

Taking all that into consideration and your guys knowledge on the schools what would you guys advise me to do.

21M , 191 CM , 92 KG , I don't take any medication daily expect vitamin d.

My work is from home for last 4 years , sitting by desk. My posture is terrrible , im sitting wrong all the time.

Long story short : Im suffering with brainfog,light sensitivity after i was doing drugs 2 years ago. Took brain scans , mri , did antidepressants for good time.

The doctors which did MRI and all the other scans for my brain told me that my brain is not damaged and im very lucky.

Took care of my mental health , by going to the gym, meditating and all of that!

But still im not feeling like i felt before i did drugs , its still wierd vision especially in light places (day sun,white lights,led lights e.t.c)

My eyes are just too sensitive for that.. Now i went to another doctor about my shoulder blade and he noticed that i have scoliosis and said my neck is too much forward “nerd neck” i guess.

Also when i go to the gym do legday / deadlifts or full body movements my brainfog gets so strong , like never before and i feel like i will pass out any moment.

Can this be a restricted bloodflow to the brain ? I really don't know.

Chiropractic,"I started seeing a local Chiro in march of 2021 for some neck pain and overall back pain due to previous injuries. At the time, I was on a subsidized insurance plan which covered chiropractic care. I went into said Chiro has a consult, evaluation, and x rays done and I was set up for 25 overall adjustments over the course of some time. That being said, Ive been to the chiropractor up until this point when they started asking me for more money while saying they can't run it through insurance. For another year they want to charge me 1,200. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the thing. Ive already paid them close to 3 grand in services - yet the original insurance carrier has covered almost everything. In march they billed my insurance 6,073 dollars. I saved $3,630.00 dollars with in network services and Blue Cross covered $1,942.98. I was left with the potential of a 500 dollar bill looking back at the paper work. So why did I pay the Chiro office directly if my insurance covered it? They claimed that my insurance only covered a certain amount but that I had to pay the aproxxn 1200 dollars to them for services. 

Mind you, my deductible for this plan was only $700. Well, I believed them and I paid that 1200. Fast forward to now and they are asking for another 700 for six months of treatments or about 1200 for the next year. WHY!? my insurance COVERS chiropractic care. This year I am on university healthcare, they told me that my deductible wasn't met so there wasn't any point running through insurance and it just makes no sense. What did I pay them for if my insurance covers the cost - and my copays are only about $20 per visit? 

&amp;#x200B;

Something isn't adding up and I am not sure what to do with this information the dates back to 2021.

Chiropractic,"Well, I lost $80 yesterday.

I have tailbone pain stemming from my pregnancy. Been dealing with it for about 6 months. It’s awful. Sitting is painful. Getting up from a seated position is painful. I just want relief. I have no other symptoms.

My OB had suggested I go see a chiropractor. I should have asked for her recommendation, because I’ve never been to one before. I have always sort of been in the “chiropractors are witch doctors” camp, but everyone I know swears by chiropractic treatments so it can’t be a total sham, right?

Well, I look online at the chiropractors in my area. The highest rated one happens to be one that a friend of mine is obsessed with. I ask her about the place. She says they have a “neurological approach” (whatever the hell that means) and she not only goes there but takes her baby there. 

So whatever. I make my initial “consultation” appointment. It was yesterday. 

As I’m waiting to speak with the “doctor” I notice he’s doing adjustments incredibly fast. Like, not even spending 5 minutes with people. He also got fussy with one patient who had stopped coming regularly.

During my consultation, he spends a lot of time talking about the nervous system and things like chemical stressors and subluxations. My tailbone pain, the ONLY symptom out of the million symptoms on his intake form, feels like an afterthought. He also would ask questions, not to build rapport, but for information.

“I noticed you didn’t put your child’s information on the intake form. Boy? Girl?”
Girl.
“What’s her name?”
I tell him her name, reluctantly.
“Oh cute!”

As I’m doing the “thermal imaging scan” he asks what my husband does. He tells me I should bring both my husband and daughter to the follow up appointment where he’ll go over the results of my scan and he’ll devise a treatment plan and payment plan he feels is best. 

I canceled the follow up appointment. This subreddit has made me realize that the heebie jeebies I was feeling were valid.

The problem is that now I don’t feel like I can trust ANY chiropractor, considering I was skeptical to begin with. But that’s not fair to all of the, I’m sure, reputable chiros out there.

So maybe I just need to ask more questions when I’m calling around.

What questions should I be asking to avoid scams like this? To ensure I’m dealing with someone ethical/reputable?

To give you a sense of where it’s located I would wrap my fingers around my ribcage and stick my thumb as hard as I could at the base of my rib to crack it but most of the time it didn’t work. I explained my situation to the doc and he had me reach for my toes, bend my head backwards and side to side. Then he laid me face down on the table and pushed on my back as I exhaled. Then was side posture and atlas? Then he sent me on my way. I was really surprised I didn’t get X-rays, time on the pneumatic table, leg length comparison and adjustment of the hip joint, and by the speed and accuracy of the adjustments (the previous one I saw did side posture on one side twice and gave up after the second time blaming me for not being compliant).

Chiropractic,"I am an experienced LMT with advanced training and specialization in deep tissue, postural and injury related bodywork. Currently I am working out of a chiropractic office as an IC, and because of some of the things these chiropractors do I have developed a negative view towards the profession.

I have some genuine questions and am seeking genuine answers. I want to better understand the field and be able to work better with colleagues, but the DCs I am currently working with might be some bad eggs.

Disclaimer: I understand every field has bad eggs and massage therapy is no exception. I don't want this thread to turn into a debate between the fields, as I am trying to develop more respect for chiropractors. 

1) What are the limitations of/for chiropractic care?
The pervasive attitude of DCs I've come across is that they think they can fix everything, and can be fairly condescending towards Massage Therapists, viewing it as no different or better than any passive therapy treatments like ultrasound or stim.  This is the biggest issue I have.

2) Why do chiropractors not refer clients out? Every chiropractor I've met is completely okay with clients coming in 1 to 3 times per week/Month with no improvement or change in their symptoms. 

I have had over two dozen clients stop going to the chiropractors after coming to me for their sciatica only to find that it was pseudo sciatica (piriformis) and not a true sciatic nerve impingement. And that's just one population example. 

3) How frequent do you realistically need adjustments, and do chiropractic adjustments help with soft tissue concerns that could be causing postural distortions found in the body and/or subluxation. Are chiropractors trained in soft tissue manipulation, assessment and treatment or at least how to discern where that treatment is necessary? 

4) From the massage perspective, ligaments aren't meant to be lose or over stretched. Could too frequent adjustment cause a weakening of the ligaments and joint destabilization? 


Those are my main questions. I want to respect chiropractors more. I originally had planned on going to school for chiropractic and found a love for the type of work I do with massage.

Chiropractic,My insurance covers my chiropractor visits… all of them and even in office messages… so I got accustomed to going roughly 2x per week since October of 2020. I am starting to think I go way to often? Are there any concerns I should have about my frequent visits? I am planning to decrease to 2x per month as I have no concerns and have just been going for maintenance. Thank you!,Am I going to the chiropractor too frequently?

Chiropractic,"Hi, I have an intake appointment for a chiropractor on Friday, but 2 hours from then I'll need to be at work. It's only about a fifteen minute drive but am I pushing it? Additionally, are manipulations usually done on the first visit? (I have a lot of pain in my arm/hand/shoulder from a pinched nerve in my neck.)

Are there particular clothes I should wear?

Also, brass tacks, I can't commit to or afford regular visits even with insurance. Is there a way to communicate that I'll be an irregular attendee? I've had to drop out of every physical therapist I've attended because of unexpected all night overtime, and my copay sucks me dry after a while.","Questions about intake, scheduling"

Chiropractic,,crooked standing and walking. how to correct?
Chiropractic,"My shoulder has been hurting for months, monstly on certain positions or when I picked things up, and I have just been ignoring it but recently it has gotten worse and hurting almost constantly

It feels like the pain from not having popped my joints for a long time (I have tried to stop doing it but it hurts too bad to, not sure if being hypermobile has any influence in that), so I'm positive a readjustment would help

The problem is I'm autistic and and have a terrible time with people I'm not close to touching me and I'm sure I'd have a meltdown if I went to have it done professionally

Is there any safe way for me to readjust/pop my shoulder by myself, or going to a chiropractor is really my only option?",I need help

Chiropractic,"Greetings fellow chiros

I recently started working with a company that his helping me with marketing, online and in office. I've been working with them for a couple of months now and suffice it to say I've been underwhelmed. The biggest problem I'm having is that I told them from the very first call that package deals are something we can't/won't do because - at least the way I understand it, it sets up a dual fee schedule that puts me at odds with the contracts I have with several insurance companies. They continue to pressure me to put together such packages though. The one they are most trying to push for me is ""1 years worth of care for half-off."" There are a couple of problems with that: 1. I only see my wellness patients every 1-3 months, so that's not even that big of a package. 2. I can't do that with acute condition patients because I don't know how long their treatment plan will take without doing an exam. 3. If they're insurance I can't give them discounts on their co-pays. 

I've already consulted my billing company and they are not keen on the idea for the reasons I listed above, but I wanted to get the opinions of other practicing chiros and I know we have at least 1 Utilization Review Doc on the sub. Do any of you do deals like this (1 yr of care for half-off, or 1/2 off an exam), do you do packages? If you do how do you structure the packages to avoid it being a dual-fee schedule? 

I know a lot of DC's do this, I see the ads for them all the time on social media and I assume that either they are cash practices, or they just are more willing than me to roll the dice on not getting caught. I have a meeting scheduled with the CEO of the marketing company tomorrow and they say that he knows insurance contracts (I kind of doubt that, but I'll hear him out) and they say that they have dozens of practices, that also take insurance, and offer these deals without any problems at all. 

What are your opinions?

TL: DR - Is there a way to structure discounts on care plans without setting up a dual fee schedule?",Chiropractic package deals &amp; Dual Fee Schedules

I have been accepted into both programs but I am taking a year off to decide which profession I want to pursue.

Chiropractic,"So I have had 2 different chiropractors treat for my ""Tech Neck"" before. The first would just crack my neck which would relieve the pain for a little while. The 2nd didn't like to crack my neck and instead focused on moving the vertebrae. 

I have just recently moved to a new area and want to find a chiro after going without one for honestly way too long( being poor and busy moving). I was just wondering if there is a clear chiropractic technique that would be the best for this condition? For instance, the 2nd chiro talked about how they used a Blair Technique. Sorry if this is a silly question, but I dont really know if there is certain techniques that work better for certain problems. If there is, I want to look for chiros that would be the best for this.","Noob Patient Here. Is there a technique that would work best for ""Tech Neck""?"
