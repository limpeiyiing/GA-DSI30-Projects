Chiropractic,"I need help from anyone who is potentially knowledgeable on this topic. 4-5 years ago, I went to a chiropractor and paid for a certain number of visits.

I went again today to a new location with glowing reviews, and they mentioned our next visit with be going over my X-rays, etc and we will talk about treatment and financing. I really don’t want to finance anything… and I have insurance. Is this a normal this for chiropractic? This is the 2nd time out of 5-6 chiropractors in my life that mention financing and I don’t want to be in more debt.

Chiropractic,"I have Blue Cross PPO and am allotted 12 chiropractor sessions in 2022.  Due to some weird pain issues, I ended up flying through 8 of them in Jan 2022. Now, I am likely to need more than 4 sessions to heal my condition.  



My chiropractor and I both know we can file a request/appeal to extend the Chiropractor allottment. However, the Chiropractor has never been successful.  Believe the Chiropractor is an immigrant so may be new to this world of insurance.


Does someone have a list of info to include?

Chiropractic,"Understood i can't get medical advice here, but hearing your similar experiences might help. 

I've always heard skepticism about chiropractor but since my husband got a big recommendation and treatment was progressing well, i thought I'd try myself.

I have a dowagers hump with minor pain only once in a while but increasing during terrible pandemic work desk situation. I just completed a week of treatment and the last 3 days have been unbearable. The doctor's theory is that i changed my pillow set up (according to his advice when i had asked him how you're supposed to use a pillow). I basically like a lot of pillows for neck support but went cold turkey on very little pillow but roll it up to fit in the neck nook.

I take 600 mg ibuprofen and can't function. I'm improving but not quickly enough. I'm regretting starting the treatment but feel stuck to keep trying. 

Has anyone else been in similar situations? What was your story?","My 1st week treatment, now feeling unlivable"

Chiropractic,"I went to a new chiropractor who i had never been to before. In the medical history form there were a bunch of options of things to check, i checked all of the ones that applied including something to the affect of pelvic pain/pain with sex. It was one of a bunch of boxes, in a separate area i specified that i was there for treatment for neck pain. The chiropractor and medical assistant came in and looked over the paperwork, he asked me about pelvic pain and i told him i have endometriosis and was working with another practitioner to remedy that. He told me chiropractic can help. I explicitly told him that i wasn’t interested in that at this point, that i was only looking to get a kink in my neck out. After that the assistant left, he laid on the table, and he started adjusting my neck and back. Without asking any questions or asking for my permission, out of nowhere he unzipped my pants, and put his hands in my underwear and started feeling around. While he was doing this, he started asking me specific questions about what it feels like when i have sex. I also feel like he got necessarily close at this point as he was asking the questions. Completely frozen i just answered quickly and waited for it to be over, left as quickly as i could and felt so sick and violated. Is there a legitimate reason for any of that?

Chiropractic,"i want to preface this by saying i am in my early 20s and have had lower back and hip pain for the past 2-3 years. Over the past month, the pain has become so excruciating that i finally decided to pull the trigger on getting help. They took x rays at the first visit and had me come back to go over what the x rays depicted. They explained that i would need 90 days of treatment (2 apts per week) and insurance would only cover $200-300. They basically gave me the option of either paying in full over $1000 or doing monthly payments of $400. They said they don’t do visit by visit payments. I feel really discouraged because i have been in so much pain and i just can’t go through with this for financial reasons. They also made some pretty condescending remarks which just put me off from them as a whole. My parents want me to go to the MD to get a diagnosis. I would appreciate anyone’s advice if you have personally experienced something like this or if you have any recommendations on where i should go from here.","had my first appointment, not sure what to think… seems like the office was just trying to get money from me"
Chiropractic,"So within the last 5-6 visits seeing my chiropractor, I've been noticing he reaches under my shirt and brings his hand wayyy up my back while doing certain adjustments, and it makes me really uncomfortable. He's never done this before while doing these specific adjustments, so I don't know why he would suddenly start now and why he'd do it without warning me first.

The first time it happened, I was kinda shocked and didn't say anything. When it happened again at my next visit, I said ""Can you do that OVER my shirt?"" and he did, and then he started making small talk as if nothing had just happened. 

In the following two visits nothing weird happened, and I thought that it was over with, but today I went back in and he did it AGAIN, except he only did it on one side, then didn't on the other side (he was doing a lumbar spine manipulation and I was lying on one side, then I would flip over and he would do the other side). He again did it without warning, and he acted like nothing had happened. 

So I find myself psychoanalyzing the situation and combing through the finer details to figure out if these are innocuous mistakes, or intentional, and I'm just really tired of it all.  I've been seeing this chiropractor for 4 years now, and he's given me the best treatment I've ever had, he's one of the best chiropractors in my area, so I'm really trying hard not to just leave. But I'm sick of this and idk why he's just started doing it out of nowhere. To me it reads like he's pushing my boundaries to see what he can get away with, and feels comfortable he can do it now only after I've been under his care for so long. 

There's also a physical therapist in the same office who I see regularly, so I'm considering just cancelling my appointments with him in the future and only seeing her.  But I don't know what I should do. I don't know if I'm overreacting, or if he's going to try to push my boundaries even further as time goes on. The more I think about it the more I want to just quit and find a new physician. 

Is this normal?  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated! I think I'm also going to post this to another ask sub. Thanks in advance.",Is my chiropractor grooming or groping me? Or is this normal treatment?
Chiropractic,"My doctor has come to the conclusion that I have an infection in my si joint which has prevented it from “sticking together”. I have painful lymph nodes all over my body and my buttocks, thighs, knees feel dull achey and sharp stinging pains. I had surgery for a ruptured ovarian cyst back in august. I had 150ml of blood suctioned out. Right after that surgery I had chills, fever and felt sick and intense pains in my abdomen. My ob was confused and said he didn’t know why that was happening. Ever since then I’ve had si joint issues. Last month I started having intestinal issues as well.

Chiropractic,"At the outset, I want to clarify that I read the rules and am not soliciting diagnostic feedback for my condition(s), but I do not have unlimited funds and would like some advice on whether chiropractic therapy would potentially be beneficial to me or a waste of time and money.  


In the interest of brevity, here are my symptoms, from least to most debilitating:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Occasional pain behind my left eye, occurring 1-2 times a day and lasting maybe 2-3 seconds.
2. A pervasive feeling of tingling/tightness in the back of my head.
3. Tension headaches that jump around randomly, sometimes like a vice at my temples, sometimes like a band around my head, sometimes mimicking the symptoms of sinusitis.
4. A constant feeling of mild drunkenness/lightheadedness. This is somewhat difficult to explain, but it is the feeling you get when you just start drinking and the buzz kicks in. Everything just feels ""off"", if that makes sense. The worse this symptom gets, the more difficult it becomes to concentrate on high-level mental tasks.

This has been going on since May of 2021, though it did not occur to me until the past month or so that it might be a cervical issue (caused by bad posture, I am guessing), perhaps in the suboccipital muscles. Symptoms are practically nonexistent right after waking up, but start to kick in after about 20 minutes and generally become less severe in the late evening. Neck movement such as craning seems to exacerbate symptoms.

Does this sound like a suite of symptoms that a chiropractor could help me with? If so, what type of chiropractor?

Chiropractic,,What’s this called and is it fixable?
Chiropractic,"So a couple weeks back I started experiencing a numbing sensation in my left arm and shoulder. 

My parents encouraged me to visit our family chiropractor. He was convinced that my spine and back muscles were misaligned which was suppressing a nerve. 

He did his thing on my back and encouraged me to come back twice a week for 2-3 weeks to see where we were at. 

Let me tell you, the positive effects of the first adjustment were felt almost immediately. I got home and noticed that my right leg “felt longer”. I was evenly distributing weight on both sides again. I also experienced a rush of blood to my extremities as proper blood flow returned. My toes were beet red and warm after having been ice cold for a week. 

To provide a little context - I had dislocated my right patella back in the Fall. I was in a knee brace for a while and did 6 weeks of PT which in hindsight probably wasn’t enough. So I’d been compensating ever since. 

This in combination with sitting around while working from home / playing video games a lot due to the cold weather and Covid were also big factors in misalignment I’m sure. 

So, sorry for the novel, but I wanted to provide some background info. 

Anyway, back to the question at hand. 

So, I had my first appointment of week 2 yesterday. Today I feel a bit dehydrated and a little dizzy. I’m drinking lots of water but I’m still feeling it. 

In your experience, is this pretty normal? I’m sure my body is working overtime to get my previously compressed nerve back to work, get my previously under-utilized back and leg muscles back in shape, etc. I’ve been sore in general which my Chiro told me would happen. 

What do you guys think? Reason for concern? Or no big deal. 

It’s probably worth adding that I’ve been experiencing anxiety throughout this process and it has impacted my sleep. Though this has improved.",Is it normal to feel a bit dizzy and dehydrated the day after a chiropractic adjustment?
Chiropractic,"Hi all - I'm here for advice as a patient/newcomer to chiro. I hope this post isn't redundant, but I checked the FAQs pinned post and didn't get all the answers I needed. I also did some searches, but Reddit's search function is spotty at best.  At any rate, apologies if I'm being a broken record.

I am trying to find an evidence-based chiropractor for my posture-induced neck and lower back pain and have no idea where to start. I'm on a student insurance plan, which limits my options somewhat. I'm considering chiro as an option, since it's more hands-on than PT regarding manipulation, and I believe I need that for immediate pain relief. However, it's also important to me that whatever treatment plan I'm on provides me tools for addressing the problem and improving it myself: since my pain seems to be extremely connected to my posture, that would mean learning tools for improving my posture at home so I can hopefully have a more healthy body going forward, especially since my career path requires lengthy hours in libraries and at the desk doing research and writing.

Are there any questions I should ask or red flags I should be looking out for while looking for a chiropractor?  I don't mind a holistic approach - I have studied cultures with a strong tradition of holistic medicine and I am not as much of a skeptic as some redditors with regards to whole-body medicine as a result. However, I also live in a very hippy-dippy area of the country where there's a lot of quackery practiced, so I'm trying to avoid the practitioners who believe chiro is a cure-all, or are anti-vax, etc.  I'm also trying to avoid getting stuck in a cycle where I need to keep going back for adjustments over and over again. 

There is only one chiropractor in my metropolitan area who is on the list of ""forward-thinking chiropractors"" linked in the sticky, and that office is far from my home and workplace. However, I live in a huge metropolitan area, so I imagine that there must be other EB chiropractors around here who are simply not listed on the registry.

Chiropractic,"I've made it no secret that I am on the vitalistic side of things. One criticism that I see a lot is vitalistic docs believe in bone out of place. The thing is, I hang out with a lot of like-minded docs (across the country, seminars and get togethers that are 300+ in attendance) and not one talks or thinks in terms of bone out of place. We discuss joints that are under stress or restricted, but not that it is ""out of place"".

Is the criticism simply just based on here-say or a bias from limited interactions? Is continuing the criticism valid, or is it similar to how the medical establishment criticizes chiropractors for stroke?

I can see old docs at the start of chiropractic using bone out of place. Back then you feel a tight muscle bundle, adjust it, and it goes away. It would certainly seem like a bone was out of place. There are even Green book stories about railroad tracks being off center and needing to be tapped back in line. Of course, now we have X-ray readily and know that the bone isn't out of place. In the modern era I am sure there are some docs that communicate to a patient the bone is out of place, but in my opinion it is moreso because it is easier to explain and the doc doesn't *actually* think that.

My question then is how widespread is someone thinking ""bone out of place""? Is it a warranted criticism, or is the prevalence really just a handful at best?","How prevalent really is ""bone out of place"" thinking?"

Chiropractic,"I went to the chiropractor today because my neck has been bugging me due to a whiplash injury from being rear ended. Long story short - he did a full body diagnostic, and white he did pinpoint the pain in my neck, back, and should, he also found that my left knee had an “angry tibia post”. What he did was have me lay on my stomach, and bend my knees sort of back towards my bum. He noticed the left wasn’t bending as far - and he sort of, I guess pressed and felt deep in the back of my knees. My right one felt normal but my left felt extreme pain. He called this a “very angry tibia post” (which makes sense, my knee cap had been bothering me a few days prior to this but I thought nothing of it. He said he can help me fix this. But he didn’t crack or adjust it (unless that’s what all the pressing and prodding was?)

My knee was fine going in - it felt okay going out - and so I went home and ran some errands and did about two hours of walking. Now I’m stuck onto my couch - it’s very sore, sharp pain if I bend or flex the wrong way. It hurts on the backside and side alot. I’ve been icing it. 

Here’s what I wanna know: did he do an adjustment on me knee, and is this normal? Because there was no cracking or popping like he did to my back, neck, and shoulder.

Chiropractic,"Hey docs, graduated 6 months ago and am now working in an upper cervical office. We do activator as well. When I initially interviewed the position as an associate the offer was 60k-100k a year with retirement matching (3%). The  work hours were 3 full days (8 hours) and 2 half days (4 hours). My training/on-boarding was suppose to be 9am-6pm 5 days a week to get me upto speed. Once I hit ""fully"" trained I was suppose to get two half days. Well I got up to speed about 3 months in and yet I've only received 1 half day shift.

 On top of that, my bonus pay is based on collections...I charged 42k my 4th month and yet we are only collecting 50% of that. 5th month in I charged 47k and still...50%. I'm in month 6 and am now seeing 50+ patients a day, charged 55k and now collections is 33% (I run my numbers every week). So at this point I'm busting my butt, but we aren't collecting enough for me to hit bonus pay (I have 5 tiers when I hit certain thresholds). And I still haven't received my 2nd half day. On top of that, I'm training another doc that was hired into the office. At what point do I ask for #1, my 2nd half day and #2, why are the collection rates for me, so low? Because at this point my base pay is 48k before taxes and I'm barely making enough to pay rent and take care of my family. The only reason we are still afloat is because student loans got pushed till may.

Also, I have asked for both my half days and yet the main doc has said they don't have answer or date on when I'll get them. I also don't get paid to train the other doc and I have been staying an hour after work helping them which puts stress on me and family time since I'm gone from sun-up to sun down most days out of the week.

That was a lot but I don't really have a place or anyone to talk to about this because only chiropractors would understand my situation. Could really use some advice. Do I go job searching, go out on my own? At this point, I'm staying only because I got two mouths to feed.","New Doc, feeling bitter and burned out."
Chiropractic,"I started cracking my knuckles and neck during middle school around age 12, and I am now 35. The past couple of years, I was able to stop cracking my neck unconsciously, but I consciously can't stop cracking bc the tightness builds up and forces me to crack it for a temporary release. After an adjustment, I feel great for a day or two but I always end up needing to crack it. I believe the main cause might be due to repressed emotions and anxiety, but the years of cracking probably resulted in a physical cause as well. Also I have a reverse curvature, so no matter how good my posture is i feel like the unnatural curve always results in some tension in the neck. I currently see a chiropractor and he uses the Y-strap which feels great. Anybody have any suggestions for me? Thanks in advance.",My neck pain

Chiropractic,"No. And I wish like anything y’all would STOP saying you do PT/are just like a PT. Or telling EB chiros they are PT/MD wannabe’s

Yea, I know the national board says PT and many states use the term. But that doesn’t make you a PT and you aren’t doing PT. 

You are a chiropractor. Be proud of that and stop wasting energy trying to define yourself to people as “kind of like a PT.”  Start defining the profession accurately. 

BJ Palmer did it with his exercise facility. Why can’t you?

It’s not PT, it’s exercise rehab, exercise prescription, modalities, ergonomic assessment. Physical therapists don’t have exclusive rights to that stuff. Any more than MD’s own blood pressure cuffs. 

They are an essential part of getting sick and injured people well and maintaining health for the coming years. 

I know, and have had the quarrel here “the adjustment defines chiro, everything else is not chiro.” 

This from the same guy who, ages ago on this sub, said he used to try to practice EB but it was so much effort and now that he is subluxation based, his life is so much easier and less stressful. 

Yea…no. In the immortal words of my old uncle…”don’t be a lazy dog.Do the work.”

Look, all of the modalities, the exercise, the tests and evaluation are in our scope. They are in our history. People fought hard for their inclusion in our laws. Don’t cheapen the profession by claiming to be something else. Add value to your own profession and make the effort to more accurately define yourself, your abilities, your skill and knowledge in the minds of the public. 

I can tell you right now PA’s will never claim to be a nurse practitioner and vice versa.  They are both mid level providers, with much in common. But def not the same. 

A DO I know says “My education overlaps with an MD’s, and I did the same residency, but the core is different.”

I see it on websites, signs and advertising all the time “we do physical therapy.” 

Why oh why?  Chiropractic is a profession. Not a skill set. Try “our expertise and experience in evaluation, manual treatment, exercise rehab and modalities gets you well and keeps you well.”

So, what sets us apart? 

History certainly does. Our background of having the title “Dr” isn’t a small thing. Sure, our history is full of DC’s who shirk their responsibilities and do just one thing. But when you look again you see DC’s who have  taken the term “chiropractic physician” very seriously. Study the people who built National, Lincoln and the other early “science based” schools. Study the men and women who ran BJ out of his own organization. Study the men and women, like Logan’s past president Bee Hagan, who went to jail for taking blood pressures.  

We have had a Dr mind set from the beginning. That other group has not. 

Diagnosis and referral sets us apart. Imaging certainly does. Not to mention the chiro specialties like neuro, ortho, internal med. 

I took a neuro CEU course with Dr Antonucci down in Miami, Fl. Holy moly, learn all you can. 

I think we need to start defining ourselves as patient centered. And we need to highlight that we use judgement and discretion. Not that we are one-trick ponies but that we evaluate and use exceptional judgement on how to manage each case. And our results speak for themselves

Selling ourselves as one trick ponies is selling ourselves way short. And “I’m a one trick pony who also does someone else’s job on the side,” is even worse. 

I agree with my colleague I mentioned before, it is the adjustment that sets us apart. It is starting at the joint level, the macro, that often makes us more effective. 

Chiropractic adjustment is an incredibly powerful and irreplaceable tool. And is is ours to maintain and nurture through research. 

But defining chiropractic as only adjusters isn’t accurate, any more than a hammer or saw defines a carpenter.  Carpenters build things. And we trust them to use the right tool at their discretion. 

Chiropractors get sick and injured people well and help them stay healthy. Trust us to use our skills, judgement and discretion. 

Chiropractors have demonstrated the power of starting care at the articular level.  Good Chiropractors also use all the available tools, at their discretion, to help patients get healthy and stay healthy. 

Most importantly of all, Do NOT be so ashamed of our great profession that you claim to be something else. Be proud of who and what you are. 

Words are important. Use yours carefully. Define yourself accurately. Don’t steal someone else’s thunder.

My question is, when I see Docs advertise their fees on an EMR like Janeapp, they’ll post their prices such as $120 for initial visit, $75 for a follow up, etc. Are these fees created through a combination of their CPT codes used to add up to those “cash” fees?

Chiropractic,"I am having a discussion with an individual to discuss the role of EB chiros and I don’t have a clear rebuttal to the answer of why chiros exist in the first place.

The argument of this individual is that chiropractors specialize in a minority subset of lower back pain and are indistinguishable from PTs when using an EB approach. The entire profession originates from pseudoscience and it is only recently that they decided to follow an EB approach.  “Why don’t chiropractors just admit their profession has zero validity and tell the public that their future practices mirror what physios do?”

Although there are PTs that don’t focus on EBP, that is a minority of what is a majority-EB profession, whereas chiropractors are the opposite. Only a minor group that claim EB while the majority of the profession are charlatans since it stems from one guy motivated by a ghost. That’s why the good and bad apples argument is not relevant in this context.

Furthermore, the individual explains that there is no double blinded study showing the efficacy of chiropractors, rendering them useless to mild low back pain, which resolves itself within two weeks the majority of the time. The only reason a patient would ever go see a chiropractor is when they are desperate and that is when chiropractors utilize tactics for patient retention, essentially taking advantage of the disabled to treat problems that resolve on its own without intervention. (Insinuating the fact that temporary relief of cracking bones creates a placebo ultimately promoting repeat and unnecessary visits.

The individual then argues that “if you go see someone and it works, then stick to it” idea is imprudent because anecdotes have no high quality evidence behind them. Anyone can make up why x works though it may seem egregious, but that doesn’t mean it’s useful in a clinical setting. The same goes for chiropractors and the relief that patients get from seeing them.

I will admit, there’s quite of ignorance to these arguments, and I do not have the perspective of a licensed EB chiropractor or extensive research on the efficacy of HVLA-SMT to answer these points.

Do you also list out ever possible side effect like a list of bullet points, even the extremely rare ones that may not have a proven causal relationship with chiropractic?
