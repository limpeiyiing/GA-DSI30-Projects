physiotherapy,"Hi all, 

First of all, I'm NOT asking for medical advice on my situation. I understand that's not what this subreddit is for. I'm just giving some context to why I'm asking. 

My father had a serious stroke in June and lost most of the movement in his right side. Fortunately he still has sensation and some movement. I've tasked myself with trying to aid in his physical recovery. 

Something I've noticed about some of the physio recommendations we've been given by practitioners and by resources online is that there seems to be a lack of practical programming around physiotherapy (at least to the public). 

For example I was given a page of exercises we can do by physio when he came out of hospital, but that's just it - exercises. No indication of how many to do or how to progress them. Basic movement patterns like stretching your arm or extending your knee.  

I lift weights personally, and a basic principle of getting stronger (regardless of where you start from) is that you need to have a program, you need to log your progress and you ultimately need to progress in some measurable way. Do heavier weights or more volume of work so that you actually get stronger instead of plateau. If you go in and do 10 squats 3x a week at the same weight and never anything more you will never get any stronger even if you do it for years, you'll just get bored.

If I didn't know that through my own physical training, I'd probably just get my dad to do the movements on the sheet of paper a couple of times a day. And I imagine after several weeks or months of not seeing much improvement I'd begin to think it's hopeless. 

I guess I'm just venting a little here as that's been my experience - Everything I find online gives me movement exercises but no program or progression plan. I ended up putting one together myself. 

Is this a common issue in the physio industry? Have I had bad physios, or am I off the mark here in how I'm thinking?",Frustrated with the lack of actual programming in the physio resources I've received/found (UK)

physiotherapy,"1st year of physio in Netherlands doing international course (foreigner from different part of Europe)

Lots of my classmates have some really outdates beliefs ranging from ""bad posture causes pain"" &amp; ""You need to activate your glutes for x amount of time before x activity"". 

All the way to more debated things like whether massage is a useful treatment method and other things about manual therapy.

We are all 1st years so we're not prepared (or also willing to in our spair time) look through and critique studies. So when we discuss stuff like like ""bad posture=pain"" I can't just recommend studies from physio's I follow for the above reason.

How should one go about discussing these types of ideas with colleagues/classmates? 


I assumed the Socratic method of just questioning would be the best approach but at times I run into road blocks in terms of my knowledge as I'm on the same playing field as they are.

I also find that these beliefs are deeply rooted within them as when their physio ""fixed"" them they used x method &amp; I hear a lot of ""well my physio told me that __ does this"" *Insert ridiculous outdated idea/treatment method.

physiotherapy,"For the memory to store anything, it had to be picked up. For it to give anything, it has to be given. These, by the picker and the giver, become consistent in knowing and interoception, theoretically.

The memory has stores. These stores are grouped by similarities. Rice can be grouped with noon — if rice is often served at lunch. Rice has its own store in the memory. New stores are created by the picker, but groupings often change.

If rice now gets served at dinner, the picker slowly takes it to the group of dusk. Rice could also be grouped with a cool chef, or a certain situation that happened in the time that rice was served and so on.

In a continuous process, stores are created, groups are made and changed. This, theoretically, can be described as a summary for what neuroplasticity also means.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitivescience/comments/rrdskv/memories\_or\_just\_thoughts\_of\_the\_past/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitivescience/comments/rrdskv/memories_or_just_thoughts_of_the_past/)

The brain changes with function — true, but function become inputs that go to a memory store, then group, so that it can be given, including its sequence — mindlessly — after a while.

The base camp of neuroplasticity is the memory.

There is the concept of handedness, right hand dominance for some, left for others, with a few ambidextrous. Handedness — or by extension, laterality — can be explained as a thought function.

In the theory of the rules of neurons, there is a thought box and a memory box. The thought box has entry ports where everything is converted to thought. This includes motor functions, sensory, physical reality, internal systems operations and so on.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/rgekso/youre\_not\_seeing\_youre\_thinking\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/rgekso/youre_not_seeing_youre_thinking_theory/)

So each eye has its own entry port, each leg, each hand, ears and so on. If it is, it has an entry port.

However, why do things convert to thought, or how?

If the memory has a store for rice, or picks up information on locations, or knows about homeostasis, the memory has a uniform unit of storage. This unit, according to this theory, is thoughts.

So the thought equivalent of anything is what goes to the memory to allow that thing to be known and give how to relate with it: walls, roads, floor, and so on, become thoughts to guide how to be cautious.

The memory stores thoughts or its form.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/neurobiology/comments/rj9lyk/low\_access\_to\_memory\_not\_just\_loss\_in\_dementia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurobiology/comments/rj9lyk/low_access_to_memory_not_just_loss_in_dementia/)

Naturally, one hand has precise functionality than the other. This function can be described as thought convertibility. When one hand writes, it is stable and coordinated, when the other does, it is awry and squiggly.

The entry port of that dominant hand has packed shapes, better rotation, often bigger and longer than that of the weaker hand. If their entry ports are adjacent, one is dominant, the other is inferior.

The dominant hand sends finessed thoughts. Whatever the memory knows comes out better with that hand. Writing can be done with the toes — on sand, or with other parts of the body if the way to do it is known.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologyresearch/comments/rhxmvm/multisensory\_integration\_is\_predicated\_on\_thoughts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologyresearch/comments/rhxmvm/multisensory_integration_is_predicated_on_thoughts/)

Knowing is the memory. Since writing was learned or picked up, it can be given to do on paper, on sand, or signing in the air.

Now, using the weaker hand or any other part of the body not adapted to a function would make the entry port begin to open and send thoughts to the memory.

The memory would pick it up, create or adjust a store, then attach it to the groups of how that thing is regularly done.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Biophysics/comments/rumclc/perceptual\_predictions\_predictive\_coding\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biophysics/comments/rumclc/perceptual_predictions_predictive_coding_by/)

So writing a letter or figure with the weaker hand gets the store of that hand grouped with writing, as well as stores of what to write.

Theoretically, thought box entry ports, memory box stores, groups, picker-giver, explains neuroplasticity.

Entry ports change with function, so do stores and new groups.

In rehabilitation, it can be described as trying to get the entry ports to open so thoughts can be converted.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for\_mental\_health\_cognitive\_triangle\_assumptions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for_mental_health_cognitive_triangle_assumptions/)

In this model, using a hand or moving a leg is by the action of the throwers of the thought box.

The hand does as wanted and as enabled, while this becomes a thought that goes to the memory to say, this is being done.

During stroke or some forms of hemiplegia, the hand may no longer be enabled especially by the action of the throwers, and the ability to have their use converted to thought desiccates.

physiotherapy,"Hi all, I'm not looking for free medical advice, I'm just hoping that someone can point me in the right direction of the right kind of medical professional to see. I've tried seeing soft tissue therapists and a chiropractor and so far no one has been able to successfully help me with my issue.
I'm 32 and about 2 years ago my neck started cracking / crunching when I turn my head to the left. It happens every time I do this movement so it isn't likely to be gas bubbles. I have not had a significant physical injury that could have brought it on, and given that I'm still quite young I doubt it is arthritis (?) . I get a lot of neck pain, although not specifically when I crack it, &amp; I believe it must be linked.
I have spent hundreds on the chiropractor, who seemed to help at first but after the first couple of sessions there wasn't any change. Now he does accupuncture to alleviate it a bit and has given me some neck exercises (the exercises do help to temporarily ease the pain), but it feels like he is treating the symptoms and not the root cause of the issue. I need someone who is going to be able to identify what is causing the cracking and fix it as it doesn't seem right at my age.

If anyone has any advice on what the right kind of medical practitioner would be for me to see (e.g. An osteopath, physio, or even another Chiropractor) then I would greatly appreciate it as I don't have a lot of money for 'trial and error' and the pain is really hindering my quality of life.

physiotherapy,"I’ve been treating a patient for a few weeks now. Late twenties, male, athlete. 

He had a tibial plateau fracture a year ago and a few other subsequent and related surgeries including a recent osteotomy about 9 weeks ago. 

He has a number of issue, one of which is poor quadricep contraction. He was also complaining about pain in his VMO today so I tried to kill two birds with one stone and went with dry needling the muscle with stim.

I hit the muscle belly at a few different spots, different angles, different depths but there was no twitching at all. He can contract the muscle a little himself but it’s pretty week. He also said he owns a TENS machine and that also doesn’t cause any contraction of his VMO. Other spots like his Gastroc work just fine. 

I’m a little perplexed why this would be the case. You would think that no matter how underused a muscle was, an external stimulation would work. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or understand why this happens. 

He asked basically the same question I did here and I didn’t have a good answer for why that was the case. I’d like to understand this a bit better.

physiotherapy,"hi there! i recently graduated with a Bachelor’s of Biomedical Science (initially wanted to do medicine) and now debating on whether i should do physio or OT. i got an offer for masters of OT and bachelor of physio. i am torn between the two due to reasons i’ve listed below: 

PHYSIO
Pros:
- i have a passion for human anatomy and the way the body works
- i majored in anatomy and human biology in my bachelor’s and can apply for credit for recognised learning to reduce the number of years i have to study
- PT’s are more in demand, more stable, more ‘respected’ as a profession, work more closely with doctors and nurses and are seen as the ‘doctors’ of allied health
- i work at a hospital and i’ve noticed that there are a higher number of physios so they seem to have better work relationships with one another and they have their own designated offices and gyms
- i like how physios get to move around more in the workplace instead of being stuck in a room majority of the time
- the bachelor’s degree is around 30k and much less costly than a masters
- physio is much harder to get into and i feel like i should reach my full potential since i got into it (although i know it’s more important to be passionate about something than care about prestige) 


Cons:
- i would have to study an extra 4 years (possibly 3.5 with credit) so it would take longer for me to become a physio
- i would have to do bachelor’s again
- i don’t really like the massage aspects and i am not that passionate about musculoskeletal function/sports and exercise 
- physio seems to be quite repetitive in terms of ‘following the handbook’ for patient rehab and i’m worried that i may become bored of just walking patients down a hallway all day

OT
Pros:
- i have a passion for making meaningful connections with people especially the elderly so i think helping patients perform every day tasks will be more rewarding for me
- OTs have a wider scope in terms of the patients they work with (children, people with disabilities, injured, neurological disorders, mental health, elderly) 
- there is more creativity and problem solving when devising patient rehab plans as opposed to physio
- i like the social aspects of OT and how you have to consider the patient’s whole life not just their body/injury in order to get them back home safely, i believe they also spend more time with individual patients compared to physios so i can develop patient relationships 
- the masters degree is only 2.5 years so i can become an OT in a shorter time than a PT
- it makes more sense for me to finish my bachelor’s and pursue masters instead of doing another bachelor’s
- not as physically demanding as PT

Cons:
- the masters degree is around 80k.. more than double the bachelor’s and i would be in a lot of student debt
- job demand is not as high compared to physios so it may take longer for me to get a job especially since i want to specialise in hospital care and they work more like ‘contractors’ 
- OT doesn’t really focus on human anatomy, more on neuro and fine motor skills
- i am not very comfortable in assisting with the bathing, toileting and grooming aspects of OT

any advice which can help with my decision would be much appreciated! :))

TL;DR i can’t decide between physio or OT. i love the human anatomy aspects of physio but i love the social/patient relationship aspect of OT. physio would take longer for me to complete but less expensive, OT is shorter but far more expensive",Physio or OT? (Australia)

physiotherapy,"Hi there, to give context I am not a medical student but very curious about human psychology and the effects it has on the body. 
I was recently reading the body keeps the score by Bessel van der kolk, and it discusses as the title suggests, trauma. 
In one specific section, his discussion of trauma and the effects it has in infancy. 
From my very small understanding of the brain, the human brain is quite reptilian until the age of two. Having read his book, I identified with some symptoms of physical abuse from his book, and how it shows in babies behaviour, but I was not abused as a child and had loving parents. 
However after speaking to my mother, she told that I was born with hip dysplasia and from the day I was born had to endure painful daily physio therapy for 9 months and wear a painful contraption to move my hips to prevent me from needing a wheelchair in adulthood. I know why my mother had to do it, but my baby brain wouldn’t have had the capacity to understand this, it would have been anticipating daily pain and fear every day for 9 months until the treatment stopped. I subsequently was quite a withdrawn, overly independent infant. 

If my hypothesis is correct, this means physio for infants that don’t have the capacity to understand what is being to done for them is very traumatic and will have the same psychological repercussions as abuse does to babies. 
This could be a strong argument against physio for babies and I wonder if it has been explored or studied.

physiotherapy,"tl;dr - Looking for good places/countries to study PT. Recommendations and personal experience welcome!

Dear r/physiotherapy Redditors,

im from Germany and in my third year of PT School. Many of you know that in Germany Physiotherapy is not a degree but a 3 year training, which shouldnt mean that the training itself is bad it's just outdated and lacks of evidence based practices. I always thought this wouldnt bother me as much since my plan was to pursue a degree in human medicine afterwards (common practice in Germany if you dont get in with your diploma/abitur) and just use the PT training as a first dip into the medical field. 

Now, almost three years later and my exams ahead of me i cant deny that i fell in love with the therapeutic practice and i dont want to miss out on that in the future. Yet im still hungry for so much more knowledge (thanks to this sub at this point, you guys showed me that PTs also make use of the access to new knowledge and studies, this aint common practice with none of the PTs i've had mentoring me during my training, which is not to say that they werent good). 

Now im torn between a new 6,5 year degree in medschool or pursuing Physiotherapy and thats where i need your help; i know it is possible to study PT in Germany at private universities, which would have the benefit that i could work as a PT while im doing that. The only problem i have is that i havent heard a lot of positive feedback from PTs who studied PT in Germany, can someone support that?

The next option would be to study in another country, where it is common that PT is a degree. My only limitation regarding that is that i could only study in english or german speaking countries. Can some of you share your experience you've had at your school/university or even compare it to other schools you've heard about or visited?

Thank you for your answers!

// sorry if i mislabeled the whole degree termini, the translation on those is a bit whacky since some of them only exist in germany and dont translate. If something is unclear please ask :)",Where to study Physiotherapy?
physiotherapy,"Hey guys! Kinda coming here for advice. I completed my kinesiology degree this year and looking to apply for Physio masters in canada (specially Ontario since I grew up here). I am open to applying to all schools. However, I took my caspar recently and did really bad. I got in the lowest quartile (supposedly i am literally a sociopath). I am over it now but I am wondering if it worth it to apply to Physio this year in ontario. 

My cGPA is around 3.77 and my 2 year GPA is 3.98. I have strong extracurriculars but not really related to physio. However I have worked at a clinic as a kinesiology (totalled around 150 hours) and currently working as a physiotherapy assistant at a LTC home (will prob total around 200 hours by the time I submit my application). 

I was just wondering if you guys think it even worth applying this year with my caspar this low. I was definetly gonna go for McMaster since they dont look at your caspar marks but everywhere else does. I know Westerns and Queens seems to want a more holistic applicant but I feel that even if I apply, they wont look at my application since I have such a low score.

And best of all, the book has been produced under a Creative Commons license, so will be entirely **free** to download.

Physiotherapy Otherwise is a book about the sociology of physiotherapy. Written by Prof Dave Nicholls, founder and chair of the Critical Physiotherapy Network, the book takes readers through a century of writing on the sociology of the professions, and shows how this literature - almost entirely ignored by physiotherapists to date - can help us understand where physiotherapy came from, why it’s facing today’s problems, and where it might be going.

The four blinded peer reviewers have described the book as ‘exemplary’, ‘highly original’, 'the single most important book in physiotherapy since physiotherapy’, a '‘must read’ for all physiotherapists’, and 'a groundbreaking, timely, and beautifully executed book’.

The book will be released in January, and there will be a Print-on-Demand option for those who want a physical copy.

Updates will be posted here on Reddit, on Fb (@DavidNicholls) and Twitter (@DaveNicholls3/@CriticalPhysio).
