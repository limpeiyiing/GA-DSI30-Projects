Chiropractic,"This is inspired by the post the other day. It is a class I never took, but I have looked up some things online about it and have applied tape to myself to try it.

As an intervention how effective is it? In my mind it seems to be something temporary that doesn't create real change, but I am openly uninformed. Back in school (a decade ago) there was some theory about neurological affects from the tape and proprioception, but again that was theory.

Is there much technique gained in taking official classes, or is finding info and guides online sufficient? Would you have patients look up online how to apply it themselves? Again, I may just be uninformed but generally the tape is easy to apply and I was able to find different patterns for different conditions online, complete with guides and videos.

If tape is effective and produces lasting results, what brands do you prefer? Are there brands or groups to avoid?",What are your thoughts on Kinesiotape?

Chiropractic,"When looking for a Chiro, what are the certifications that you think are most valuable? I know the FAQ kind of touches on this - it mentions a couple of different technique specific certification, as well as looking for FTCA members. But in regards to technique specific, I think that's a rabbit hole and ""good"" technique is probably viewed more subjectively/depends on what you're looking for etc. With FTCA, while it's probably a good sign of their approach, it's just a membership and doesn't require anything concrete. 

CCSP/DACBSP are the only ones I've come across that seem to be well regarded and imply a good quality of overall care. Are there any others you guys think are notable or worth looking for?",Certifications to look for in a provider
Chiropractic,"Hello!  3 years ago I went to a chiropractor complaining of a tight neck.  He asked me to get x rays which i did and discovered my neck needed the curve fixed and recommended to see him 2-3 days a week for 9 months and use the denneroll each night.  Im a piano player who's had back and neck issues from poor posture so it wasn't a surprise i had issues.  After the first adjustment my neck got stiff as a robot, he claimed this was normal?  

anyway luckily it did go away after a few days.  I proceeded to see him for another two weeks and started to notice greater rotation in my neck. as well when i sat at the piano i had zero back issues all of a sudden and it felt great.  I also found myself wanting to sit taller, and not lean over the table when eating my dinner.  All good things i imagine.

However, 3 weeks later after treatments I got a bad cold and started to get a clicking sound when talking or burping near my right ear/jaw.  I called the chiropractor and he said to contact an ENT.  So i went to 3 Ent's and they could not find the problem.  I also went to two dentists, and  2 other chiropractors for opinions.  Nobody has been able to figure it out.  The other two chiropractors do not think its related to chiropractic adjustments.

Long story short... im curious what this community thinks ... could this weird clicking sound I get when talking be a result of getting my neck adjusted?  Is it possible the adjustments put something else out of line?  Strange thing is when ever i get a cold now, the clicking subsides for the duration of the cold.  

I'd hate to think the chiropractor i saw messed me up for life with this annoying issue i've been forced to accept and live with.  Luckily it is not painful, but as a musician and teacher, its unbelievably annoying and depressing as every note i Sing or word I say usual ends with this internal clicking sound  near my ear.  I've also tried the Neti pot for weeks and prescription sinus spray to not avail.

Chiropractic,"Hi Fellow redditor. To get it straight the left part of my body is not the same as my right now. You'll probably say everyone has differences between both sides but the problem is that mine are pretty significant. 

First of all, the most visible thing is my muscle dysbalance ; every muscle of my left side is minimum 1.5cm(0.6 inches) less bigger (in circumference) than on my right side. The problem is not how big my muscle are but how they feel. On the left side their loose and they aren't tensing up while working out. I started the gym 1 year ago and the muscle growth on my left side is really slowing me down. It feels like my muscle on the left side aren't used at their full potential. 

Other than that I grow more hair on my right side than on my left side. It starts from my ""beard"" to my feets. 

I also can't flex my muscles on my left side.

Chiropractic,"This is my first time using a chiropractor. I recently injured my lower back and I tried to do as much research on my local chiropractors and went with a Gonstead chiropractor in South Florida. 

First visit was pretty standard, he consulted me and did a physical and history along with getting my Xrays while standing up. He took it multiple times (\~4) because he was a perfectionist. I was told to schedule for a 2nd visit because the DC doesn't do same day diagnosis and was charged $300 ($75 for consultation and $225 for the xray). 

I scheduled for the next morning and came in and he diagnosed what I assumed was happening to me, L5 herniated disc (although I've been told to truly diagnose herniated disc requires an MRI scan), and it matches my symptoms of not able to bend forward or back past a certain point without feeling a sharp pain. He then tells me ""great news"" how this is a mechanical problem more so than a medical one and he is confident to take on my case. He initially told me he wanted to see me for **six months** ($2800) and then dropped it down to 2 months ($990). When I asked the front desk lady if I could just do 1 month to try and see they told me the DC won't take my case unless it is 2 months or more because he requires a certain amount of time with me to get me healed. It just seems to be a lot of red flags but is this expected? I understand each DC has a treatment plan but locking me in for 2 months or more after charging me $300 left a sour taste in my mouth.

My current job is at a Physical Therapy and Chiropractic clinic which I went for because I was applying to Occupational Therapy school and I'm still waiting to hearing back on. But I've realized I really like Chiropractic. I'm looking at schools and could start at Logan in May. 

However, I've read a lot on this sub and many people talk about the debt and default rates. Which is completely different from the statistics Chiro schools have sent me. I've seen a lot of people here push for DO, PA, and NP over DC. I've looked into DO, but I know that's extremely competitive to get in. But I'd be much more networked and related to medical cannabis which I'm currently in a Masters program for. My bachelors is in Exercise Science with a 3.6 GPA, and I'll finish my Medical Cannabis Masters next year with hopefully a 4.0. I'd have to take a couple chemistry and physics courses as well as the MCAT and get some hours somewhere to give D.O. a shot. So I'm really on the fence on where to invest my time and money.

I'm not questioning that chiro works, cause I know it did to fix those issues, but I'm worried that due to how my body had formed itself over the years to adapt to what it needed to do daily, that correcting my spine may have made things worse.

Chiropractic,"So arguably The Joint is the largest and most successful single entity in chiropractic. Currently valued at about 791M, I'm pretty sure it's worth more than all of the chiropractic colleges and professional associations. When I was in outpatient clinic, my staff doctor had bought and opened a franchise location. At the time I thought it was dumb, that they weren't charging enough for care, and why pay the franchise fee at all, just open your own practice. 

I get a lot of patients from there. People who are wanting a more focused experience and better quality care. Having never been there myself, I wonder what the experience is like for patients and patients as customers. I'm imagining it's efficient and a good value, if somewhat inconsistent depending on which chiropractor they end up seeing. 

I'm really just bullish on the company because I believe in chiropractic as a product. And I feel like long after I've closed my doors and stopped practicing, their locations will keep working and probably open new ones. So why not continue to benefit in some way by being an investor? 

The stock is now arguably overvalued on fundamentals but at least has pulled back with the rest of the market and now sits firmly below its 200 day moving average. Not that it can't go a lot lower, but, you gotta start somewhere...

Chiropractic,"I'm not looking for advice. I'm just trying to find an explanation. I think chiropractic reddit can explain this better than orthopedic reddit.

A couple years ago I was at a trampoline park with my kid. I did a butt bounce and felt my middle back scream out. If you put your hand right underneath the front of you rib cage, it was the opposite side on the back.

I was really sore for a few weeks. This subsided into a general discomfort, and I felt this need to constantly stretch that area of my back , but I could never find the correct position. I also experienced a slight decrease in mobility when twisting my torso. This was not debilitating. I could still lift with no pain, just a general discomfort and need to stretch. I experienced it for almost 3 years.

I recently started jiu-jitsu.

At one of my first classes, I was drilling a back mount escape.

Here's a link to a pic for example. I would be the guy in the blue gi.

 [1.jpg (250×188) (ultimatejujitsu.com)](https://www.ultimatejujitsu.com/images/techniques/foot-lock-against-the-back-mount/1.jpg) 

I was slightly arched towards my partner, attempting to escape, when my partner pulled back on me to regain more control. His feet had my thighs immobile, and he had one arm hooked under my armpit. He basically pulled me gently and firmly into a more arched position while keeping my lower body immobile.

I finally got that stretch I've been looking for. It hurt so good is the only way I can describe it. I also had five distinct cracks in my middle back. I groaned loudly in relief. My partner thought I was hurt. I just laid there for a moment basking in relief, and then carried on with the drill.

My middle back muscles were a bit sore that night, not painful, more like DOMS. A little advil took care of the soreness that night. The next day I was no longer sore, and my back felt great for the first time in years.

Ever since, I've been discomfort free, my mobility has increased, and I don't feel the need to stretch.

Chiropractic,"I'll try to keep this short. It started with my wife going to get checked out for her sciatica, she did the whole exam &amp; x-ray to start out. She was given a schedule of 3 times a week for 24 weeks at $60 a visit.

I also went to go checked out, and apparently my hips are slightly rotated. So he scheduled me for 3 times a week, 14 weeks. 

The sketchy part for me is when he did the lateral arm strength test to see if my spine was in balance. He would deliberately put more pressure on my right arm than the left and say I'm not in balance. After my first adjustment, he did the same test but I felt him put way less pressure on my ""weak"" right arm. So he said the adjustment is working... It's making wonder what else he is lying about?

A typical session for us is about &lt;3 minutes for an adjustmen at $60. Is normal for other Chiropractors?

But here's the thing, my wife said she hasn't had sciatica since she's been going, so it must be working right?

He's also a chriro for babies and kids. Which might add to the severity of his lying since he could be scamming whole families. I see them come in and out in less than 5-10 minutes.",Trying to figure out if my Chrio is a scammer...

Chiropractic,Hello I'm running into a big issue. I have a lumbosacral transitional vertebrae on my left side. And it is not supposed to move but it can in my case. And when it does get out of line I can't get it back in. When it's not sitting right I walk different. I can feel it all the time. It also causes loss of control in my left leg and feels funny and restless. My whole spine gets out of shape because of it. I tried so many practices to help me with it but no one can realign it. I was able to do it myself when I was younger but it doesn't work anymore. I'm so desperate since last time it was sitting wrong for a year and was almost put in a wheelchair.

Chiropractic,"I have already been to my local chiropractor. I am 6'7"" 21 years old former athlete but did not play any collegiate levels sports, just for fun freshman year so im assuming my knees are going to wither away eventually just being tall and a former athlete from wear and tear. I went because my knees felt painful about an 8/10 at its worst, it felt like my patellar tendon was bruised and very tender to the touch. This started a couple of months ago thought it was just from heavy squats as I had knee pain in my right knee on July 26th of 2021 and asked a family friend who did heavy weightlifting and is a registered dietitian as well as a director of kinesiology at a university so he knows how to do things the right way, with the correct form with low weight, etc... He said maybe jumpers knee so I did some rehab myself, iced, stretched, laid off heavy squats, and did low impact and low weight leg days. Fast forward to now, it is in both of my knees with the same symptoms, and sitting down elevating it is the only thing that helps but it begins to hurt when my bodyweight goes over my knees, and sometimes when I walk it would feel as though my oblique popliteal ligament is very weak and my knee may hyperextend but it never does. 

PLEASE let me know if i am being guided in the right direction or being given false information, i 100% trust this guy and wouldn't know any better. He recommended to not squat for 2-3 weeks, work on my deadlift form and to try to increase some glutes and hamstrings. He said my quads are really tight and although a compliment, said my quads are solid but may be the problem. I was recommended to use the couch stretch: hold onto a chair in front on you and put one leg on the edge  of  a seat or couch, kneel on to the knee of the leg that is on the couch, bring the foot forward, use the chair to push my neck and  chest up and shift forward to stretch out my quads as he said was REALLY tight. Is he giving good advice to work on deadlifting full ROM (no rack pulls) with no squats. I need to go back to him as he never gave me any alternatives to the no squatting, as leg press also sends pain to my knee.

Chiropractic,"I will try to keep this short but i am a VERY tall (6'7"") former athlete 21 years old with some hip discomfort. I went to the chiropractor but i had other problems so we didnt really get to touch on my hip specifically since it isnt extreme. Basically it feels as though my hip pops out, obviously it doesnt dislocate because i would know that pain and it aint pretty from what i have heard/seen. It can do this ""popping out"" anytime i walk and its like i stumble and habve to grab something because its too painful to walk on that side of my leg and then it goes away or it dramtically ""pops back in.""  I do a standing twist keeping my leg and foot stationary and  twist my body until I feel that pop and it makes it feel better. Whenever i squat/deadlift/leg press even going heavy it NEVER  happens then JUST WHEN IM WALKING and step wrong or something. But i dont want my hip to dislocate or pop out squatting or using leg press with 200+ lbs  on it that would injure me badly. I will start to use my thera gun to try and see if loosening the muscles would help because i have no idea whats going on, whether its pelvic tilt or something that is weak. I started doing adductor and abductor machines at my gym to stretch and try to build some of those muscles but those arent helping either.

Chiropractic,,Sciatica Nerve Pain &amp; Low Back Pain Treatment by Hyderabad Chiropractor Dr. Rahul Gulve
Chiropractic,"Good Evening, 

I've been experiencing some significant lower back pain over the last couple weeks. I'm pretty sure it's from a work related injury where I was rushing and bending and lifting improperly.
I was referred to a chiropractor and I went in for a preliminary visit where the chiropractor took x rays and measurements and told me on my next visit that he would review the x rays and go over my treatment plan. Before even doing all this, he prefaced that my pain was likely from a misalignment of my neck that was causing strain on the rest of my body. He said I was too young (I'm 32) to have significant back pain from over extending it or bending or lifting improperly. 
I was charged $45 for this initial visit. 
I returned less then a week later to review the x rays. The doctor showed me my x rays and said my hip and spine were perfect and there was nothing wrong there. He said my neck was misaligned and it was the root cause of all my pain. I'm not an expert, but looking at the x rays, my neck looked relatively normal. 
He then started talking to me about NUCCA, which I hadn't heard of before. He explained what he would do and it would correct my lower back pain. 
He then went over the pricing. He said I would be given 13 visits and I would have to pay $3000 in advance or 3 monthly payments of $1000. The first visit would be the only time he would do any corrections. The rest would be follow up visits where he would check if I'm healing properly. 
He said there was no option to pay one visit at a time. I said I would have to think about it and he tried to pressure me into making an appointment first. He did say if I make an appointment for the initial correction, then I would have to put some money down as it is a significant block of time if I were to cancel.
After that I just said I would call them at the end of the week. 
I did further research on online after and found out a lot more about NUCCA and I don't see any justification for paying $3000 in advance for this procedure when it only includes one correction 
I was hoping some more experienced individuals could comment and give me their feedback on this.

The other recommends the same but without acupuncture and the whole CBP 36 visits deal. They are very focused on correcting the curves.
