physiotherapy,"Are you familiar with the expression? Maybe not, but you are definitely familiar with what it means and where it originated. 

A patient with a self limiting problem like a ""tennis elbow"" gets bored with his first physio because after a few weeks of treatment nothing much happens. He changes physios and after a month or so, again, not much improvement. He changes again and gets angry because of the ""incompetent"" therapists. Again, after a month or so, he sees a little improvement but not much. And again, here comes the next physio. We're about 6-7 months into treatment and things are improving a little. Maybe of natural causes, maybe it's the treatment. The patient gets bored again and, yes, here we go again, therapist number 6 enters the stage.  

Now, after nearly a year either all the preliminary work of all the previous physios bear fruit (or Mother Nature kicks in) and tataaa, improvement! Healing!

And who did it? Yes, obviously the Last Physio. 

This has some interesting consequences

1. The Last Physio could have done to that patient whatever he wanted, he would have improved anyway (as long as he did no harm). But the therapist and the patient now both believe this treatment is *The Treatment* for tenniselbow. The referring doctor may believe the same. OMG

2. The Last Physio gets a big ego boost. Because of that he will behave in a more confident way and this has a big positive influence on his patients. Super placebo!

No other illnesses bar chronic pain and now this left shoulder issue. 


Dear Mr Xxxxxxx,
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my referral. Michael has been attending my clinic recently for management of ongoing Left shoulder/CSP pain and tension. Following your most recent injection therapy and Michael‚Äôs continual strengthening the lateral shoulder and Upper trap/ Sub-deltoid bursa pain have resolved significantly. Michael has however developed non mechanical pain in the chest wall. Upon assessment this pain is quite consistent in nature but diffuse in anatomical location. On palpation the pain appears to be mostly presenting around the Subclavius muscle and into the proximal insertion of the anterior scalene into the first rib in the subclavian groove and the origin of the SCM (medial portion of the clavicle). To date we have worked on soft tissue release of the subclavian/SCM/anterior and middle scalene and have continued to improve Deep Neck Flexor strength and general R/C &amp; scapula-humeral stability. The pectoral muscles do not appear to be indicated upon assessment and Michael has continued to maintain full active/passive ROM in the left shoulder with ongoing improvement in strength/stability.
 
Michael‚Äôs pain however is not improving to any great extent with manual/exercise therapy and continues to be quite irritable at night. Other than the consistency of the pain and the non-mechanical nature of the symptoms there are no red flags of note with no reported aggravating factors or peripheral referral to the shoulder or hand.
 
I would very much appreciate your expert opinion on Michael‚Äôs most recent symptoms and your assessment of the neural structures such as the accessory nerve to examine if this may be responsible for the continual discomfort that Michael is experiencing. If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me at any stage.

TL;DR: Been dicked around by medical practitioners regarding my wife's muscle/body imbalances that are causing upper back, shoulder, and hip pain from a long sedentary lifestyle. Looking for a strategy to better communicate with them relevant information to actually get a diagnosis/treatment plan.

Hello First and foremost I am not looking for medical advice. I am looking for advice on how to find and communicate with a physiotherapist so they can give in person medical advice. A certain approach, keywords or something because all they seem to want to do is drag out the appointments and not even talk about the issue.

My wife and I are 28 and live in Canada, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. She is 5‚Äô 1‚Äù at 120lbs.

This all started when she got stress fractures in both her shins from doing a few kickboxing classes, she went to her GP and all they told her is to do low impact for a month and didn't recommend us to a physio. A month later they weren't any better so we went again and pretty much got the same response as last time just saying ""it takes longer with some people"". We decided to go to a Physio without a recommendation and the first one we went to just did acupuncture and ultrasound to ""speed healing"". When we asked for an exercise prescription they just kind of dodged it several times.

Frustrated we tried another place where the physio gave her an exercise prescription and briefly inspected her saying she was tight in places that she shouldn't be and when asked if there was a hip imbalance he said yes but apparently ‚Äúyou are just born that way there is nothing you can do‚Äù which we know for a fact she wasn‚Äôt born that way, regardless the next step for the physio was to have my wife‚Äôs feet and gait measured and those graphs were all kinds of up and down with the worst being her right foot arch is collapsed which again we were told ‚Äúthere is no way to fix that but orthotics can help‚Äù, so to deal with this we got the custom orthotics but also began to do some research on our own.

This research lead us to some exercises for strengthening the muscles in the foot arch and I can confirm that it has been fixing the ‚Äúunfixable‚Äù arch in her foot in addition to finding out that my wife has ‚ÄúAnterior Pelvic Tilt‚Äù which was putting extra strain on her shins making them heal really slow or not at all. We managed to fix  it after about 2 months of doing exercises which again we found online but we knew there was more wrong with her posture and alignment so we tried pushing for an x-ray to maybe see and confirm if there would be a supposed leg length discrepancy or if it is just posture, to which we got a response of ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too much radiation to put you through for this‚Äù.

Again frustrated with what we were being told and not really given any proper diagnosis we tried 2 other physios that continued the trend of not really paying attention to what we were saying, coming up with half assed exercises that they point us to a video with and don‚Äôt even help her get the form right which she can‚Äôt even get right because of her imbalances.

Finally we decided to try a chiropractor and they actually bothered to measure her tilt, showing it to be a few degrees tilted at the hips and shoulders and managed to get her some temporary relief in her back and shoulders, but again that is only temporary.

From our own research at this point (Again not from a practitioner of any kind) we pieced together that she may have ‚ÄúKnee Valgus‚Äù on her right leg as it bends inward, ‚ÄúLateral Pelvic Tilt‚Äù with her left hip tilted higher than her right, and a ‚ÄúRotated Pelvis‚Äù with her left side more forward than her right which is causing all sorts of pain in her hips, groin, upper back, and most importantly underneath her shoulder blades leading her to having poor quality of life, feelings of despair and panic attacks as no one seems to be able to help her.

My overall impression is that either these people don't know what they are doing or just trying to turn my wife into a forever customer by just applying a ""bandaid"" on the issue and not addressing the underlying cause, however my hope is that I just am not saying the magic words that properly describe the issue and get them to actually understand what I am asking of them.

I assumed that it was supposed to work like this: 

The GP hears your issue, recommends you to a physiotherapist, the physiotherapist gets your relevant medical history and does a physical examination, measures your range, checks for imbalances, maybe gets an x-ray to confirm the exact degrees of tilt, displacement or if there was an actual discrepancy with leg length. After that a treatment plan is made to strengthen and/or stretch muscles to slowly get things back in line with hands on guidance to do the exercises properly and with good form even if it requires recommending to a personal trainer with a reschedule appointment every few weeks to check progress and readjust the exercise program, but to be honest I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just a grocery clerk and this is my assumption.

At this point all we are doing is scouring articles and youtube for exercises that can strengthen the weak muscles on one side and relax the tight muscles on another but we are nowhere near medically knowledgeable and it‚Äôs just panicked trial and error and we are really desperate. 

Conclusion:

Really sorry for the long winded post I didn‚Äôt know what information would be relevant so i just put the whole story here, I just want to know if this is at all normal and hoping that there is just specific terms or way I need to approach a physiotherapist to get some proper treatment, it has been ruining my wife‚Äôs life she can‚Äôt be active without any pain and at this age that‚Äôs a tragedy. My wife has not had any broken bones or serious injuries that could have caused these things to be unfixable, we believe that it is from years of a sedentary lifestyle since a child to young adult crossing her legs a lot and leaning to one side and over time for hours at a time at home/work and it just really screwed her postural balance, but this should be theoretically possible to fix fairly easily just with a lot of time and dedication of doing the right exercises and not encouraging bad posture and sedentary life.",Advice On How To Better Communicate With A Physiotherapist (Not Medical Advice)

physiotherapy,"So I've already asked a question about Bob &amp; Brad, but I realised that hey, this subreddit could also help me a lot with my general approach to weightlifting.

I want to make sure I can weightlift successfully for many, many years (the rest of my life if possible: I'm 21 now) to come. I enjoy it, it improves my mental health, and has many other benefits. 

I am also acutely aware of the risks involved with weightlifting - namely, connective tissue injuries and wear-&amp;-tear. I want to avoid these as much as possible. 

Since I'm barely a month into weightlifting (though I did have a 4 month period when I was 17 where I did it, which ended in right wrist tendonitis), I want to set good habits now. For now, I'm struggling with **potential** areas of injury - namely, my unstable shoulder, my left knee (with twinges at the patellar tendon), my left elbow (a result, I think, of my unstable shoulder and weak left wrist), and finally my right wrist, which has been unstable and weak since my injury.

Right now, I'm mainly worried about how to approach the first few months of training, which are characterised by large increases in strength, muscle and stress/load on the tendons (while I know that tendons in particular are slow to adapt to greater loads)

I'm someone who has recently restarted going to the gym and weightlifting, and I know how important it is to train safely and to make sure my tendons strengthen alongside the muscle. I've historically had wrist problems, and recently I have started to have some knee, shoulder and elbow pain.

I'm doing exercises to sort these all out, and generally I base these exercises all on the advice of Bob &amp; Brad on Youtube.

physiotherapy,"Hey all

Curious to hear peoples thoughts on the matter, as I often hear conflicting things, it's either:

* Community isn't interesting, too generalist, and in case I was told: ""community is where physio's go to die"". I've been told by community trusts that they often struggle to fill physio vacancies due to the lack of demand

or

* Community is great, offers flexibility, insight into patients lives, a better ability to build therapeutic relationships, and generalist (but in a positive light)

I'm leaning towards the latter. While I have good communication skills, I'm somewhat introverted, so my ward and busy outpatient experiences have been very tiring. Seeing less patients, and having breaks between patients sounds like my cup of tea.

Arguably, I could be missing out on the development that comes with a rotation or another specialty, but this final year of study during COVID has been a ball ache, just want to settle into a job I enjoy and move out, so the idea of going straight into a community position appeals to me.
