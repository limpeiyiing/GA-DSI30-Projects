physiotherapy,"Hello! I am a physiotherapist located in the United States. I am currently working with the HCPC to get my license in the UK however I’ve been notified they need further information regarding my education and work experience more specifically for respiratory care. 

I have read through some previous responses on this subreddit regarding respiratory therapy as a specialization for physios in the UK. One thing that is more specific to North America I believe are respiratory therapists who do many things including suction and airway management. Physios in the US do not typically do this kind of treatment. 

My primary work experience has been in musculoskeletal outpatient clinics as well as home health where I do see a lot of cardiopulmonary types of conditions. 

My main question is, will I not be considered for qualification based on the little experience I have with respiratory therapy, specifically suctioning? To me it seems like this is a specialization some physios may do but not a requirement. I have knowledge and training in assessment of lung fields, percussion and drainage with positioning techniques, breathing phases, spirometry, breathing exercises and energy conservation techniques.

I'm (UK MSc Student) currently having to prepare for a debate into the for/against of Physiotherapy-injectors. 

I've been placed in the team against the appropriateness of physios filling the role, however, I'm struggling to produce a single argument point of substance. In part, this may be due to my opinion being more pro-extended scope practice such as injections, but I'm struggling to find anything online providing an against argument, too.

Anyone on here willing to help with the negatives of physio-injectors, anecdotal or otherwise? Or is this debate null-and-void?

physiotherapy,"Pardon my language but I'm not sure what's the technical term for that feeling you get when you maximally activate muscle to the point of getting that cramping feeling, hence, ""the squeeze.""

I once had this patient who obviously had weak calves which were holding him back from running. We did some other things (hip strength, running form education, etc) but when it came to prescribing calf raises, there was an odd issue.

He could do both **single** and **double** leg calf raises to similar degrees but he said that he ""doesn't feel his calves tensing"" during the single leg raise. Looking at his form, he was cheating *a bit* during the single leg raise - but it was a tiny difference.

I figured that his subjective feeling of muscle exertion was a sign of better control and activation and so we stuck to **double leg** calf raises.

&amp;#x200B;

This got me wondering about all the times we tell patients to ""squeeze"" their glutes for dear life during a bridge. Is getting that maximal activation more important than just sheer weight? I know this is a basic concept but I take it for granted sometimes.","Does ""the squeeze"" you get at the top of a calf raise matter?"
physiotherapy,"I had Salming floorball shoes now for a bit, but they started wearing out, so I decided to buy a new pair.

I bought Asics Gel-Beyond, because I liked that they are a bit thicker and I thought it might be a benefit for me since I'm a bit on the heavier side (105 kg). After wearing them for a few practices I developed a pretty annoying pain in the ball of my foot. So I started googling and I found out that they are volleyball shoes and that they might not be great for running. Now I would like to find out whether the problem is caused because the shoe is new and I'm not used to it, or because these shoes are not made for running and I should just buy new ones.

Anyway so after the interview, HR contacted me immediately saying that the interviewees both really liked me but she just needed to confirm with a clinical reference before an offer can be made.

That’s when my heart sunk. I don’t have any references clinically. The issue is, in my previous placement, I had different supervisors, when I asked if they could be my reference they said they only knew me a week so no. 

My previous reference, the supervisor was a new grad and wanted to confirm with the main supervisor which is on annual leave prior to being “allowed” to give me a reference.

The previous placement to that, was at a private practise, I did so well, however when I asked my supervisor to reference a previous job, she gave them a negative review for some strange reason. She gave me a 90 for that placement and she tried to hire me herself too.

physiotherapy,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted a physiotherapist (PT) perspective on if I should switch PTs or stick with my current. I'm not going to dive too much into my case but here's a quick summary: I'm in Canada, 25 y/os, active, in decent shape (gained 15lbs of bad weight due to injury, but still average body comp). After 10 months of conservative care, I ended up getting a L5/S1 microdiscectomy &amp; partial-laminectomy end of Aug-2021. I did not have shooting pain but did have sciatica and major discomfort - it did severely impact my quality and life, thus, moved forward with surgery. 

Post-surgery. I was referred to a well-known PT in the city that has experience dealing with back surgeries and started working with him mid Oct-2021 (6 weeks post-surgery) and have been working with him to this present day. As someone who had (still have a little) PTSD trusting PTs due to my conservative care phase, I told myself for my post-op rehab, I will fully follow whatever this PT tells me to do. I see myself as a stoic individual, but I even cried in his office about how tough this entire pre-&amp;-post-op process has been for me two months ago.

So I'm \~6 mths post-surgery, 4 mths so far working with this PT. From day 1, my rehab program consisted of core strengthening (dead bug, bird dog, plank variations etc). At my weekly 30 mins follow-ups, we catch-up for a few minutes, he might re-assess a few things but we go to the gym area and a workout that's **different** than my take-home exercises. My exercises have remained the **exact same** for 4 months and I've trusted the process this entire time as I am feeling better but in recent weeks some questions/comments have popped up in my head:

* BOTH my hamstrings are extremely tight since my initial injury, 9 months before surgery and 6 months after surgery. For the past 15 months I can't bend past my knees (before seeing a physio for the first time in Nov-2020 who messed me up, I could almost touch my toes). My current PT told me at the beginning ""you have to keep strengthening your core, so your brain will turn off the ""alarm"" and will then release the hamstrings"". It's been 17 weeks since starting post-op rehab and I'm at the exact same place, can't bend past knees. My core is definitely so much stronger now than it was before, it's just frustrating that I haven't seen an ounce of progress in this area when my core is indeed strong af now.
* I've always wondered why I haven't gotten ANY progression exercises for my rehab, but again I thought this is just the progress. I was catching up with an old school mate who just started practicing at his clinic and he happened to just check me out real quick and said that my psoas muscle on the right is extremely tight and these exercises I were given for 4 months straight with no change is not going to address ""neural tension"". This further amplified my lingering concerns.
* I feel scared/uncomfortable to ask questions anymore. I previously asked ""What is the framework in my rehab from an high-level view, is it XYZ step 1 then once we hit those boxes, it's XYZ step 2?"" OR ""what else can be done to address this issue or that issue"" and I've always been given, ""keep doing the core exercises"" as a response. Obviously there's more instances but I don't think you want to know all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a people-pleaser/shy. There's this other physiotherapist I want to try that works at a good clinic, but I can tell from social media my current PT and him follow each other. I just don't want to disrespect my current PT by going to him, but I just want to get a second opinion especially since I've been doing the same stuff for 4 months straight and am asked to continue to do so moving forward. I also don't want to waste the second PTs time for a second opinion if the industry doesn't really like to do that (Idk?).

What are your thoughts? Should I stick it out with my current PT? Or reach out to the one I want to see? I've been really stressed about this for a few weeks and I honestly lost a bit of confidence in my current one. Am I just being overly stressed for no reason?

physiotherapy,"Hi, 

I would like to ask you what do tou think about this. I have a scoliosis with not that big degree and need to wear a 2cm heel on my right foot. I was training core a did some exercise which they give me in hospital. Then I decided that I want to try get rid of that heel so I found a specialist in my city. It is a guy who really seems like he know what to do and he told me that I should stop doing exercise on core. That muscles should be liquid and should take care of the most important thing- bones. What do you guys think about that? He showed me exercise where i am lying and have my legs on cylindrical fitball. He is saying that it is more about feeling. He shows me how to lay and how to decompose the weight. How to play with rotations in my body. It felt good at the beggining. I also learned a little how to do it at home. He is very expensive so I can rarely come to him. Right now I do not know what to do because I do not feel good. I feel weak and I don't know to do it as good as with him. I think that it could be useful if i was going there for a year once a week but I can't. I also do not feel good when I work out and I still have in my mind that I shouldn't.

What do you think about that? What do tou think about liqiud muscles and scoliosis? What would you do?

physiotherapy,"Hi all,

I've heard of private practice employers keeping new-grad physios on reduced wages for ""onboarding"" while they await AHPRA registration and then their Medicare Provider Numbers. The argument seems to be ""we can't give you your own caseload until you have both your AHPRA and MPN, thus, we can't afford to have you earning a full salary yet""  


I understand needing an AHPRA number before having your own caseload, but a MPN too? Do you need a MPN for those customers not coming with bulk-billing Extended Care Plans from their GP?

The above argument/rationale seems dodgy if your private practice caseload is overwhelmingly not clients on EPCs, right? I thought an AHPRA number is all you needed for non-EPC clients.",[Australia] When do you need a Medicare Provider Number?

physiotherapy," I am coming from the perspective of a physiotherapy student in the Netherlands at this issue. This is an essay on the deliberate use of placebos in treatment of patients. There are some trends I am responding to that I noticed in my field and adjacent professions. There are wavering trends and misconceptions about Placebo use in treatment of people who's illness is hard to treat effectively with conservative treatment. So is there a place for placebos as a treatment option? From a therapist perspective telling your patient that there is nothing you can do for them is hard. So we have some pressure to deliver something rather than nothing. From a scientific perspective placebos are an important cut of line for the value of a given treatment. Placebos are a mix of many different effects that influence a patients reporting. They happen by them-self and because of this they often are the only thing comparing groups show as a sign of improvement. Some studies looked at administering a placebo treatment by themselves and it looks like they only have a provable benefit if there is deception on the outset. But why not consider this as a form of treatment? In other words Why not deceive our patients? To start I will lay out the case pro placebo. If there is nothing better to do the case seems best to be made. We see placebo groups in every good double blinded trial. The groups receive a pill with no effect and/or a talk about the upsides of some unexplained intervention as a beneficial one for their problems. In these groups the positive effects are often attributed for the pro side to the placebo debate as a mind over matter effect. In other words patients become better because they will it so in one way or another. Up front I would inject that many things do get better by them-self, but the pro side often frames these effects of time as being supplemented or even mainly driven by patient believes. So why not use these effects to woo patients into feeling better? Even if they happen on their own. Giving a woo explanation for them might make patients feel better, because they take note of them. These outcomes might be hard to measure scientifically, but making patients feel better might be worth while by any means.    The first thing that comes to my mind is the question of transparency. Most treatments have well studied effects and side effects and patients are informed upfront about them. With a placebo and a deception we could try the same thing. Informing or asking the patient about the use of deception in our treatment, but that would certainly be a weird discussion. Leading to a possible failure to make the placebo work its mind over matter effect. The trust between the therapist and the patient would probably be harmed and the belief to be treated by a quack can cause the opposite, a nocebo effect, to take hold. So there is no good way to deliver the placebo supplement in a ethical way. Given everything at most this turns out as a wash. Even besides this interviewing skills focused on post treatment reflection can have the same benefit of making the patient aware of the improvement over time without having to explain them in some forced way. The question is secondary if you think about the actual proposal to use deception upfront. What if you are actually deceiving yourself by just forcing the patient to give you better outcomes, because of the social pressures. Patients might think that you want to hear that your treatment whatever it might be was effective. Leaving your practice not really being helped. Instead they just make you think that you did some good, maybe because of the level of enthusiasm needed to deliver your mind over matter supplement. So we wouldn’t know in the end. From all angles this question of transparency makes me positive that placebos with a pep talk flavor are no good for clinical practice. If we want to do good, being honest is the best thing to do: “I am sorry but I don’t know if there is an effective treatment for your condition.” This is the course of action that helps patients become aware of their actual circumstances. The earlier this happens the easier it will be to face reality or actually notice when things improve for any reason. Watering down this clarity will not help to find things that are helpful and in the end nothing works better than knowing that placebos come along for the ride either way.",On Placebos as treatment

physiotherapy,"Hey all, 
     I’m in the midst of a pretty complicated predicament right now and am looking for some advice. So I’m born and raised in America, completed a bachelors in biology at a university there and was planning on continuing my study into a DPT program. However, once I graduated (December 2020) my mother wanted to move to Australia (we’re also Australian citizens) so off we 
went. I missed the application cycle for bachelor of physio programs in 2021 so I instead applied for the 2022 cycle and would be starting the program this year in late Feb/ early March. However, my mom now wants to move back and I know I’m going to end up working in America once I finish my degree. Since she wants to go back, I am now applying to American universities and have deferred from university here for the time being. 

My question is, knowing that I will be working in America, which option makes the most sense? I could start studying now, be done in 4 years, then move back to America and spend about a year or so completing the licensing exams and completing the t-DPT program. Or, I could apply this year for American universities, start next year and finish in 4 years as well and start working right away. Regardless, both options take the same amount of time and I would start working at roughly 28 years old which isn’t bad at all. The Australian option is much cheaper with lower “interest rates”, but I’m not sure if going to an American university is the safer (less headache) option in the long run, or does studying in Australia then transferring over to America not matter as much as I think it does?

Has anyone studied in Australia and then worked in America? Any advice would be appreciated! 

Oh also, since I already completed a 4-year degree in America I wouldn’t have to make up much classes if any since I already have all the prerequisites for a DPT there. 

Also for clarification I am applying for bachelors programs instead of masters programs since my major in biology barely covered any pre-requisites for a masters program in physiotherapy here in Australia. I could take the prerequisite courses then enroll in a masters program, but at that point I’d already be halfway through my bachelors.

She has a lot of work experience already. She wants to know if it is possible to work in the US, particularly either in the states of Texas or New York.

But sadly my sessions ended before even I realized I had a couple of questions regarding the exercise.

So I know I start by bending my neck downward, rounding my shoulder and focus on folding my back, working my way down vertebrae by vertebrae. Now in the effort to make sure I start bending the one above before the next one, I not only squeeze my quads and glute -which I was told is necessary to keep my legs straight- but also embrace my core and contract the abs to initiate the bending motion; sort of like a reverse leg raise. Only when I reach as low as I can go, would I exhale to loosen up and go a bit further down. The same with the way back up. The question is; am I supposed to keep my core loose and let the gravity do the work, like a controlled fall of my torso, and purely focus on the leg/hip drive on the way back up while maintaining the looseness at my core?

I consciously avoid breathing out on my way down, because it feels like I am putting my spines under load instead of the muscles when I do not engage my core by not holding my breath. It just doesn't feel right, especially considering how I'll be loading it up with some weights later on, albeit very light. But then, I was told my obsession with keeping my back straight all the time in attempt to keep it safe is what's given me the pain in the first place.
