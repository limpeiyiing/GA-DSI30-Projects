physiotherapy,"Hi, I'm looking for some information to guide me. I don't have anyone that I know personally and with the way things have been recently with Covid I don't want to just turn up at a private physio and start asking questions so I'm hoping for 5 minutes of your time please.

At 34 I finally know what I want to do and where to go with my life. I've been working as a Mental Health and LD Support Worker for about 8 years now, 7 years in the private sector/community and almost exactly 12 months within the NHS. My short term goal was to get into the NHS, the long term goal was to become either a physiotherapist or a paramedic. I'm really wanting to go into physiotherapy more than anything.

The problem is, I have no idea what to do. I know I could just apply to be a physio assistant and hope for the best at the time but that's not enough for me. I know another route is university, I do have a child so this isn't the ideal way in but if it's what I have to do then I will do it. The other issue is that I don't think I have the right requirements to get into uni. I have a level 3 in health and social care which I did in college,   I also have level 3 heavy vehicle mechanics and I did public services in college at 16. None of these are good enough. What do I need to take in terms of evening classes to get me on my way, do I go for something like biology or sports science? Or both? Or neither and something else?

What other routes in can I take and what do I need to do to position myself in the hope of increasing my chances. I don't care how long it takes, and I don't care how much studying I have to do. I really enjoy learning now (unlike when I was in my early 20s) and it's actually a bit of a hobby of mine, so nothing is going to put me off.

Please anybor all information would be appreciated as I don't know where else to ask at the moment. I know nothing about unibersity and what is entry requirements. I'm also a little unsure of what other options are available.

physiotherapy,"Hi everyone!

Canadian practicing in Australia here.

I've got this patient I've been seeing for a couple month. I gave him a few weeks off as we were working through the last bit of neck stiffness and dequervain's and it was getting better and better.

Last night this patient came for a follow-up. His dequervains has gotten worse. Finklestein's is positive, decreased grip strength and there is a bit of atrophy through the thenar eminence. 

I'm gunna assume he might have some sort of peripheral nerve pathology combined with dequervains, but I'll investigate when I see him next time as well. I just wanted to know your thoughts.

physiotherapy,"Hey guys, I’m a physio student from the UK and have seen one of my lectures use an app called “PT Helper Pro” which was really handy as it had a plethora of out-of-the-box exercises that I would never think of for body parts.

I have a weightlifting background so I’m more experienced in prescribing exercise for healthy people, but have found it slightly challenging at uni to complete case studies where I need to give exercises to patients who have had a total knee replacement for example.

physiotherapy,"I'm a non-US student and right now my class is under going discussions about multidisciplinary team, and I'm quite confused about the PT's scope of practice, compared to other healthcare professionals. Will those with experience be able to help out with my understanding about the different roles? 

I just found out that OTs can also teach breathing techniques and energy conservation techniques. I was wondering for a pulmonary patient when doing co-treating, who would be the one ""in-charge"" of educating and following up on this? I understand that PT works with the patient's aerobic capacity, but I understand that OT needs to address this if it's interfering with their ADL training. 

Dietitians does the 99% of weight management, but it's not unheard of for PT to also address nutrition issues. For example, I read papers that states it is also important for PT to educate nutrition and diet, especially if it's impacting their condition (e.g. OA). However, everyone's being vague in saying ""education"". I don't think they meant for you to just say ""lose weight = healthier"", so I was thinking what type of education a PT can do that does not overlap with a dietitian's education  topics as well.

I just read a comment here that PT can use CBT in their treatment. But isn't CBT only administered by a trained psychologist? How can PT conduct CBT on a patient? I understand motivational interviewing, but to the point of CBT? I do understand the benefits of doing CBT with the patient but isn't this creeping into the psychologist scope of practice?

Nursing does suction in airway management. I understand, but apparently PT also does suctioning. In a normal setting, if the patient needs to do suctioning, who would be in charge of it? Nurses or PT? I understand that it doesn't matter and everyone should help each other out, but because PTs usually have only 30 mins of consultation time, I assume Nurses have to be the main here, but Nurses are also handling different patient in a ward. So I wonder who will step in, in this scenario?

At the same time, PTs can also work in ICU. I saw in the US there are Respiratory Therapists, I was wondering whats the difference between the jobscope between the two. Based on research, I know both can be in a ?code blue team, and only RTs can be present in airway management during surgery, but aside from that, I have no other clue.

My friend is studying to be an Exercise Physiologist, which he said he can prescribe exercises. I only know that they are usually to administer CPETs like Bruce Protocols if the PTs are unable to, but apparently it seems that PTs also can't administer CPETs in a hospital setting? Can someone clarify? I'm actually really not sure what an Exercise Physiologist does, as I assume they are mostly research oriented...

Does TMJ management goes under Speech Therapist or PTs? Also, I understand that Speech Therapist trains the speech muscles only, but I've read they also do neck muscles as well as it also helps in swallowing. Same thing, to what extent does STs trains the muscles and which one falls under the PT?

Hello;

I have been suffering from a strange problem for 10 years now. I have been in a lot of physiotherapists and osteopaths without much success, which may alleviate the symptoms momentarily but not in the long term. The thing is that the whole right side of my body is very stiff and this causes me a lot of discomfort in different places: first of all I have a lot of abdominal tension especially on the right side and this causes that when I take a deep breath I notice a blockage in that area (diaphragm) as well as pain in the neck (scalenes) on the same side. I also feel instability in the shoulder and hip on the right side. When I am very stiff I cannot release the tensions no matter how much I stretch the affected areas, but my body clicks all the bones in my body to release them, especially the hip, neck and shoulder. In addition to this my first rib is elevated compressing my brachial plexus so my right arm is often numb or crampy. I also have noticed that my right shoulder is lower than my left. There are times when I manage to be quite well by doing a lot of postural correction work, stretching and diaphragmatic breathing but the problems always return and the tension lasts for weeks. 

   
 

I would like to know if any of you have experienced something similar and if so, how you have been able to solve it. I am quite desperate to find a solution as I live with chronic pain and this wears me down physically and mentally.

Im a 38 year old Male, been mostly sedentary since my late 20s.

When i stand in front of a mirror and lift my left leg so my thighs are parallel to the floor my lower leg is in a straight line vertically. 

If i do the same with my right leg, from my knee down it turns inwards when i get to parallel. This is also the leg that is the least “mobile” when i kick, as performing a round house forces my hip and torso over too far it seems.

However, he's also having me use the rigid tape and it seems so wasteful. I do exercise six days a week and strapping each time is a lot of tape. Are there other alternatives?

He said wrist band wouldn't be right. Would bandaging work as well, then I could reuse it?

physiotherapy,"Hello guys, I’ve been asked a few times in private about any update regarding the condition, and gathered myself up to do it at last.

&amp;#x200B;

Herewith the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/66okkx/how\_come\_i\_cant\_fully\_extend\_my\_legs\_how\_could\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/66okkx/how_come_i_cant_fully_extend_my_legs_how_could_it/)

&amp;#x200B;

It’s possible! I’ve no longer wooden legs and my flexibility has improved tenfold. So how did I manage to fix this?

&amp;#x200B;

It started over a year ago, when I took up muay thai classes. For starters, muay is thai boxing, a form of boxing that involves all limbs (I believe it’s also known as ”the 8-limbed Art” or something along those lines). I was looking for traditional boxing lessons but I had the opportunity to practice with a friend of mine who’d just begun coaching that discipline, and I went for it in spite of apprehensions I had. What were these, you may ask? Well following the initial object of the post, you could rightfully guess that the utter lack of flexibility in my lower body sapped any confidence I may have had regarding any physical activity that required a given amount of suppleness in the legs; so for a long time boxing was the only viable combat sport/martial art in my mind. Which is really a silly way to think now that I think of it! But as long as I believed that I was bound to stick with my condition, that only minor improvements were possible, it remained true, until fate gave me this occasion to see how my mindset would stand as I confronted it with reality.

&amp;#x200B;

So I must be thankful to my friend as well, who spurred me toward the right direction by affirming that it was all attainable and more within a given time.

&amp;#x200B;

Muay thai practice was thus the first step toward serious improvement as far as I’m concerned. What did the trick is that I had a goal to attain, a proper state to strive for, which encouraged me to implement the necessary steps in order to attain the required flexibility at each stage of my progression.

I had done yoga before for short periods of time, I can neither dismiss it or vouch for that as it wasn’t nearly long enough a practice to assess its efficiency rightfully; however over the same time period I can affirm that the progress in that regard was much faster, I could witness solid results after merely three months.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless it was after about three months that I faced my first proper hindrance with regard to suppleness development in the legs, and that was hip flexor pain in my right leg. I couldn’t throw kicks anymore because of that, quite annoying as they’re obviously integral to the practice, so I had to see a specialist as advised by my trainer. it was quickly followed by a deadly lumbago, something that happened about every year or so for 4 years and that was getting increasingly concerning. I went to see an osteopath and from then on it all went uphill. What really kicked it all into high gear is that we now knew what was up, not only with my crooked legs but my back pain and everything that was going on with my posture really.

&amp;#x200B;

It appeared that due to a scoliosis that developed in my teenage years and hadn’t been addressed, my body adapted to it posture-wise but was starting to meet its limitations as far as this strategy’s concerned, resulting in localised complications such as the lumbago. Another important factor was my feet whose weight was distributed too much inward.

As a result of the diagnosis the osteopath indicated the specific movements that needed to be applied in order to get the body to a healthier, therefore suppler state. It’s likely that most if not al those areas should be targeted if you have the same impediment as I did:

\- Hip rotation

\- Back extension

\- Back rotation

\- Hamstring stretching (obviously)

\- Psoas stretching

\- Adductor stretching

&amp;#x200B;

Having that information, all that was needed was to share it with my coach who designed a specific program relative to these types of movement. I have a battery of them in case you’re interested, but the exercises themselves don’t matter as much as knowing what area to work upon and how. At any rate I HIGHLY recommend you to see a skilled specialist so that he or she gives a precise diagnosis as to what’s going on. While it sounds as sensible as it gets to most of you, I haven’t done it and it would’ve been so easier had I done it earlier. My other recommandation is to practice a physical activity that forces you to up your flexibility, so that it doesn’t become boring. Once an effective routine is found there’s nothing more dangerous than resting on your laurels, and there’s no doubt it works better as an incentive within the framework of an encompassing physical practice that hinges on steady progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I took care of the feet issue by seeing a chiropodist. That’s a real big deal because one’s whole posture rests upon his feet, and even though all the exercises are done correctly and regularly, the feet’s incorrect placement is ever going to hinder the process of getting the rest of the body back into a healthy and balanced. It may or may not be the case for you, which would be great, but that’s how it’s been for me and I’m wagering it’s likely to be same if the issue is excessively tight hip and leg muscles and chronic lower back pain. It’s directly related indeed. The solution for that after the chiropodist’s diagnosis was to practice specific exercises (the same I’d mentioned earlier) and to wear dedicated soles so the feet would return to a normal state after at least a few months’ wear. It’s been a year I’ve been wearing them and the improvement has been tremendous.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s how it is folks. For personal reasons I quit muay thai after 10 months, although it’s been a wonderful journey and I eventually wish to practise it again; I still do stretching exercises once every few days, with more or less intervals in between, which isn’t as much as I used to do for about the first 9 months since seeing the osteopath. I used to do it every day, especially in the beginning, and the reason for the decrease is that I finally broke free of that, the state I’ve reached as far as flexibility and lightness of movement are concerned is beyond what I had expected for the greater part of my life. I still try to push the boundaries once in a while but the goal has been attained, and I’ve moved on to other things now, and there’s no need to focus on this issue anymore. I’m willing to try yoga again one of these days; as for now, my primary physical activity is dancing which is something I wish to be good at someday, and that became infinitely much easier once I got my posture in check.

physiotherapy,"I’m a relatively new business (self-employed is very common in the UK) so my client numbers are quite low especially starting during COVID times.

This is leaving me short, money and time-wise and is quite disheartening to say the least. Do any of you experience this? What do you do about it? Should I be worrying so much or just move on and focus on my regular clients? 

I do explain with every new client that comes that the first session is going to be a thorough assessment (subjective/objective, lifestyle, etc.) with rehab exercises demonstrated and prescribed towards the end, and that they may experience a slight spike in pain as we have been testing the joint/muscle/injury to try to find the root of the problem.

physiotherapy,"If you search Reddit or the wider internet for posts related to Osteopathy, you will come across a large number of comments and posts that describe Osteopathy as pseudoscientific quackery. 

In the UK at least, Osteopaths and Physiotherapists share ~70% of their curriculum and training. In many other countries (off the top of my head I can name Belgium and maybe Canada) you are required to train as a physiotherapist before you can become an Osteopath. I am currently studying Osteopathy, and I was excited and surprised when we were taught how to read blood reports, ECG results, and test the cranial nerves. I guess I thought I’d just be fixing bad backs. 
Yet I rarely see the same criticisms of Physiotherapy, so I started considering what differentiates these professions, and potential reasons why Osteopathy receives criticism. 

The main reason I arrived at was that Osteopaths don’t have treatment guidelines in the same way that Physiotherapists do. Two Osteopaths would likely have a different treatment plan for the same condition, whereas from my experience Physiotherapists will vary at lot less. 
This could be due to some Osteopaths (the minority, from my experience) following the teaching of A.T. Still and his model of medicine very closely. This usually involves an emphasis on techniques that have been shown to work with anecdotal evidence. Personally, I don’t have a problem with this as long as the patient is well informed and the practitioner isn’t claiming that Osteopathy is voodoo magic that can cure anything.

I’m echoing the perspective of /u/MedlifeCrisis (who runs a wonderful YouTube channel). 

I was curious on other perspectives on Osteopathic treatment, it’s public perception, and anything else you find relevant. This is super interesting to me, so thank you for any input!",Osteopathy Discussion
