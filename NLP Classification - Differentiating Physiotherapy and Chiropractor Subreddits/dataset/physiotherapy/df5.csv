physiotherapy,"Hello, 

I have a rather complicated long story. But I have a fine arts degree and later realized I have a passion for human movement and human anatomy... I decided to switch gears a bit and consider physio school. In the past two years (within the pandemic) I went and got certified as a personal trainer, completed the requirement for physio schools in Canada, wrote and published a workout guide and even considered mentoring under a physiotherapist (shadowing) but was unable to do so due to the pandemic and them not hiring volunteer sue to the pandemic. 

I applied to two Canadian schools and got rejected in both , my GPA was a 3.42... Is there anything else I can do to boost this GPA , or what I would need to do to make my applications stand out more for next year/ when next I apply.

I am a bit bummed and trying my best, I don't mind moving to a different country to pursue this. but what next steps should I take?

TLDR: switching careers, and got rejected from two physio schools. what should  I do?","rejected from Canadian Physio school , next steps?"
physiotherapy,"Hi all,

I have got a mate who currently works in business looking for a bit of a career change. One of the careers he's interested in doing is physiotherapy; however, I have told him about the pros and cons of this career pathway but he obviously wants to hear it from others as well.

He may also consider a construction management degree which I told him would offer a higher pay ceiling than physio and probably may not be as fulfilling but long-term I think it's more down his skill set.

So on 10 Dec, 25 Dec I dislocated my knee and having done the whole cast and crutches thing I was given a hinged knee support from my Ortho Consultant and referred to physio.
I saw a physio fir the first time on Monday and she observed I had a lot of laxity in the joint and significant loss of muscle tone. 
She felt that the knee support was impeding recovery and told me to stop using it immediately.

So I got couple questions that I need to ask to you experts out here :) 

I am using Muscle Relaxant(cyclobenzaprine) it is a GREAT medicine, its not great its Awesome,

I used different pain killers, Muscle Relaxants nothing worked, I take **Cyclobenzaprine** and go sleep. When I wake up no pain no stiffness no stress perfectly fine for the day.

So my questions.

1) While I am taking this muscle relaxant my neck doesn't hurt and Hernia gets relief , no pressure so do you think hernia gets heal? Or hernia stays as it is and doesn't get healed.

2) If it doesnt heal my hernia does that mean I will use this medicine forever?

physiotherapy,"I had a patient recently who had some clear impairments but no obvious injury.

This young patient - who runs short distances 3 times and does a fair bit of strength work - complained about feeling ""unsteady"" or just ""uncomfortable"" on their right leg whilst walking or running. They seemed fixated on how asymmetrical their gait feels too.

In terms of pain, they had a lot of R) foot pain, mostly in the toes and midfoot. There's also some anterior thigh+knee pain during deep squats.

**The really weird thing is watching them walk:** Their L) leg does everything normally however during R) stance, they kinda 'snap' into posterior pelvic tilt and their knee hyperextends slightly as they enter hip extension. Note they *don't* hyperextend from the point of heel-strike like you'd see with tight calves or hemiparesis.

We tried some gait training and whilst he could control his pelvis better, it still felt ""off"" to him.

In terms of impairments:

* Very tight hamstrings: \~30 on the straight leg raise. This is the only unambiguous finding. Tighter on the right.
* Potentially weak hamstrings: Visually they look weak but he could just barely do a nordic curl and had 4/5 for an oxford muscle test.
* No issues with glute control. The patient does a lot of abduction work on their own and could easily do single leg squats, almost to parallel

physiotherapy,"I don't believe this is asking for medical advice, rather physiotherapeutic practice, but please let me know if you believe I have broken rule 1.

I went to a physio once and she used some thermo-conducting cream on my swollen patella post fracture and used ice directly on the skin to bring the swelling down quickly.

At home I have always used frozen gel packs however she told me that they are ""warmer than zero degrees"" which has me confused in terms of thermodynamics and also in terms of being healthy for the skin/site.


My conventional knowledge is RICE and that combining compression and ice is effective. which is that you should usually have a layer between the ice and the injury, and then you can tightly tie on that ice.

Now thermodynamics is confusing, because regardless of what temperature you freeze a gel ice pack at, the pack itself will be freezer temperature. However I think there's some confusion in terms of how the cold is transferred. For a lunchbox, you don't want a fast conduction rate, getting your food really cold to start the day, and thus gel is a great option.

Whereas for a site injury, water has two great advantages if ""really cold"" is desired:

It melts quickly, which causes all the ice to get slightly colder (thermodynamic principle, the warmest part of the ice will melt, leaving colder ice). It also leaves water, which is a fantastic conductor and directly on the skin can sit in your pores, and then again when it warms up, it will evaporate, leaving the colder water on your skin.

What do physiotherapists use, and should I avoid ice ""packs"" for sports injuries?

physiotherapy,Adam meakins approach is mostly foucused on desensitization of painfull areas and strengthening of supporting muscles and it makes sense when we talk about sedentery people but what about physical workers with LBP(or any other pain) ?

physiotherapy,"Hi

I was recently told about how I was diagnosed with hypotonia at a young age (I think it’s the kind associated with autism not the benign kind) it doesn’t affect my day to day life now but I remember it doing so earlier in my life and during my school days.

Over the last 10 months (8 of those I’ve been doing weight training) I’ve lost 80Ibs I still have some more weight to lose but I’m beginning to get concerned with my lack of muscle, Ive been following proper nutrition and training 6 days a week. My strength has near enough doubled but there’s been no noticeable physical growth.

My question to you is does hypotonia prevent muscle growth? Is there no chance I’d be able to look muscular after my weight loss if I stick to my training?

PS: I’m in the UK I don’t know if I need to let you guys know or not.

Thanks",Can I gain muscle with Hypotonia

physiotherapy,"Hi, I'm a 4th year physio student from SA.

I suspect my patient today had a patella dislocation (injury happened in December 2021) but she only sought treatment for it now as the pain in her knee is starting to bug her.

She had a direct fall onto her knee, felt like something popped out of place but was able to weightbear on the leg immediately after the fall, and sometimes feels like the knee is giving in. 

Did all the specific tests for the patellofemoral joint (had pain with compression, positive apprehension with lateral patella glide) and her patella is located more laterally and slightly superiorly compared to the other knee. She has now developed somewhat of a valgus of this knee (hip adduction and internal rotation with the knee now looking more 'knock-knee' than the other knee). Her foot is also more pronated on the affected side compared to the unaffected side. 

She also complained of posterior knee pain (at the pes anserinus insertion). She has pain with isometric knee flexion. Is it possible she developed a compensatory pes anserinus tendiopathy due to altered biomechanics caused by the maltracking of the patella as it's no longer in it's groove?

Aside from that, does anyone know which treatments I can use? It's months later now and usually this is treated conservatively but that option is obviously out the window. I did some TP release of her hamstrings, some VMO and glute medius strengthening. Any other ideas on what I could do to reduce pain and return the patella to it's correct position or is strengthening to improve active stability the only option here?",Can you get a pes anserinus (hamstring) tendinopathy due to a untreated patella dislocation?
physiotherapy,"(Apologies if my terminology is off, it varies a lot within this topic)

To my knowledge, accessory glide mobilisations are mostly a pain-relief tool and a way of increasing ROM in very acute or restricted patients. It is not something I use in my sub-acute setting.

Those who do use it, tell me it has 3 mechanisms of working:

1. \`**Pain gate:** When we take the joint through these specific movements, we stimulate mechanoreceptors which inhibit nociceptor activity associated with that movement, allowing the glide to occur with less restriction from muscle spasms.
2. **Mobilising/stretching the capsule:** Sometimes a glide is restricted because the capsule is tight in a specific direction. By manually moving the joint, we stretch the tight fibres much like you stretch a tight muscle.
3. **a bit of placebo**

Number **2** is what confuses me. I don't know if there's any evidence that you can actually affect this change in the capsule with these movements. **Does anybody know of any literature exploring this question?**

It's an important question because I've had many patients with obvious, acute capsule tightness but not much pain. These patients don't need the pain relief effects of an accessory mob but if point **2** is true, than it's still worth doing.

I've got nothing against the technique, I just don't do much manual therapy.",Is there evidence that accessory glide mobilisations actually change/affect the joint capsule?

physiotherapy,"I hurt my oblique doing kickboxing training last week and I’m wondering if it’s worth my money to see a physiotherapist. I love physiotherapists, they have helped me get through so many injuries but for this one I feel like they wouldn’t be able to do much and simply tell me to rest, which I know to do. I don’t have insurance and as a striving athlete I’m not very wealthy, I train full time so it’s quite expensive for me to see one. If you guys know that they will help then I’m willing to spend the money to see one but thought I’d ask first.","Broke striving athlete here, wondering if a physiotherapist help with a strained oblique."

physiotherapy,"I consulted a physiotherapist due to prolonged leg pain. 

In the second session, I noted that there was a diploma in ""Usui Natural Healing"" hanged in the wall. 

This name sounded an awful lot like pseudoscience, so I googled it, and guess what? Pseudoscience it is. 

So, in the next session, I asked her if she was using ""Usui Therapy"" to treat me. Gladly, she said no. She rarely uses this method. 

She said that she's using ""Neurokinetic Therapy"" (terapia neurocinética in Portuguese. I'm in Brazil) to treat me. 

I googled this therapy, concerned that it was pseudoscience as well, but I couldn't find much.

Is this a science proven form of physiotherapy, or is it bollocks just like that Usui thing?",Is neurokinetic therapy a pseudoscience?

physiotherapy,"I am a physio student in Greece where for the last 40 or so years physios got there degree from Technical Educational Institutions. 2 years ago the government made all Technical Educational Institutions Universities. So I am given the option to pick one additional semester with 5 lectures to upgrade the degree ( or that is my understanding of this mess) to be an University degree. I am now at a dilemma and i not quite sure what to do. I can not find any practical pros of doing it and I would like to ask if some knows if there are any. 
I am considering the possibility of doing a master later on in my life and have no clue if not going for the Uni will affect that. I am also going abroad to Germany to work once I finish and I have again no clue if not going for it will affect my degree and rights as a physio negatively.

physiotherapy,"Sorry, if this is a little close to asking for medical advice, but it's more about who I need to see.

 I'm based in the UK and have had a long running shoulder issue. All the impingement symptoms were pretty standard. After paying to see various physios and then an orthopedic consultant I've ended up having a cortisone shot which has somewhat helped. In addition I've had an X-Ray which showed no problems and a couple of ultrasounds that showed nothing except inflamed/enlarged bursa.

However, I'm still nowhere near fixed. Basically every test for subscapularis involvement is positive. Lift off test I can barely move my arm, belly press causes some pain as does bear hug test. I also have quite limited internal rotation.

When I last visited the physio they just gave me stretches. I'm fine with some of these but I'm also scared of causing more damage.

My question is what to do next? Should I try a different physio / try and get further imaging / go back to the ortho surgeon. Just looking for advice, not so much a diagnosis.",Every test I do suggest subscapularis issue - no professional I have seen has picked up on this. What next? (UK)
physiotherapy,"I am a student physical therapist in PT school. In the last year I've noticed PT friends admitting to shoplifting in a regular basis It began with one friend so I assumed it was an anomaly. But more and more seem to be doing it now too. It's frankly shocked me to my core as I thought that these were good honest people but now I question how they be trusted to not rip off patients especially when they've no remorse? 
My question is, is this a common occurrence among physical therapists as I am aware that PT mills are big in the US and Canada (and all of these kleptomaniacs are actually Canadian)
