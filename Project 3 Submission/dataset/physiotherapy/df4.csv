physiotherapy,"I have a 27yr old neuro patient who had an accident 7 yrs ago and a decompression craniotomy. He recovered, had little short term memory loss but that also was okay.

Last year he was put on anti depressants because he was depressed as all his friends were achieving goals in life and he was not able to.

A week after the start of anti depressants, he wasn't able to balance himself properly. The doctor said to continue the medicine as he'll adjust to it. 2-3 months later and now his condition had worsened.

He constantly keeps his head flexed. When I ask him to lift it up he does but within 5 seconds would again flex. Balance is very poor. He's falling constantly and moving backward. Speech has become fast and volume of speech slow. This all started after the antidepressants. Now he just keeps his head flexed all the time. MRI showed nothing, everything was normal. Doctor stopped the anti depressants and said to wait a few months for it to wash out. Now it's been 6 months and he's just the same.

I started working with him a week ago. I tried to make him stand and he's constantly raising his heel upward. I made him stand with the support of a wall and he's constantly just raising his heels. We asked him to stop and he said I'm unable too. This happens when I wask him to stand straight. When he tales support of wall and moves his legs a little in the front, it doesn't happen.

Could it be a neurological issue? Or should I just try to break the pattern? Should I recommend him to the neurologist again (they have already said scans are normal)?

physiotherapy,"I'm not asking for medical advice on my situation but questioning two assessment methods that seem to provide opposite results. 

Every physiotherapist I've been to seems to follow a route of muscle strength and flexibility assessment with exercises provided to stretch tight muscles. 

I've recently found out about the McKenzie method which focuses on directional preference to alleviate pain. Now to be clear I don't experience pain which is alleviated via McKenzie method, however I do experience a large improvement in posture &amp; well being following certain exercises that seem to be somewhat the opposite to physiotherapists suggestions. 

Physiotherapists assessments = tight quads &amp; hip flexors (stretches provided), tight hamstrings (nothing provided), seemingly strong glutes (some strengthening provided). Results no real improvement. 

In contrast, MDT method with no direction from a professional = Childs pose &amp; hero pose provide very good relief and improvements with other things like deep squats, downward dog &amp; 90/90 exercise also helping. 

Essentially I feel awful in Hip Extension but experience improvements in Hip Flexion.

I finished uni a few years ago (I am now 25). 1 year into my English-related course, I took a year out due to a bereavement. When I came back I wanted to change my course to something health/fitness/sports related, but 1. my uni wouldn’t allow me to change courses and 2. I didn’t have any relevant A-levels. 


I finished my course anyway, and ended up with a BA in a subject I’m no longer interested in. I needed a job and to get on my feet after struggling with my mental health for so long. I didn’t want to get a job related to my degree, and I was too lacking in confidence at the time to do a personal training course, so I got a job as a lifeguard as it’s a vaguely relevant qualification that I already had. 


My workplace is a military clinical facility that rehabs injured and disabled vets/athletes/complex trauma cases etc. I’ve been really inspired by what I’ve seen while working here and I’d really like to get involved, but don’t know how to start. The only xp I have that could be relevant is a few years volunteering at a disabled swimming group where I taught and supported in the water.


I feel that younger me’s career choices are going to hinder me greatly. I feel like I’d struggle to get qualified in anything without even a single relevant A-level to my name.


Today I got talking to one of the physios that works here, who said I could potentially observe or shadow them when I have free time (there’s lots of downtime in my job) and maybe even get work experience here at some point. 


In terms of getting qualified, they suggested that I could first do a biology A-level (which I didn’t know I could do) and focus on getting experience as mentioned, and at some point in the future I would need to get a degree. 

The idea that maybe there could be a way for me to do this after all has made me really excited as there isn’t much opportunity for career progression as a lifeguard. Even more so because it would seem that I could potentially do a lot of the learning etc while still working my current job due to the amount of downtime I get here.

I work for a large allied health company with over 600 clinical staff nation wide. There are several (at least 5 come to mind off the top of my head with 100s of smaller ones servicing aged care as well) of these in Australia. According to the Physiotherapy board there’s ~33000 physios in Australia with general registration. 

The aged care sites I’m working at have already said they’ll no longer require our services instead relying on their diversional therapists to do tai chi with their residents. In my opinion the new model will create a situation where resident deconditioning will be financially encouraged more than it already is. 

Coupled with the political rhetoric from the health ministers: https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-targets-aged-care-over-servicing-by-physiotherapists-20220318-p5a5wy.html

The APA is “fighting” for increased funding but it seems like a toothless organisation. Every time they try to advocate for something it doesn’t happen or improve the situation no matter how much they spruik their efforts 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️",[ Australia ] Will the new AN-ACC funding model for aged care cause an over supply of physios?

physiotherapy,"Hello, I am Thomas Eddie, and I am currently in my 5th Year at the University of Strathclyde. My final year project centres around the elderly with a focus on the issue of falls and other injuries when navigating the home after surgery or living with a long-term condition. I feel that the mobility aids that are currently available are not particularly suitable for independent living and do not engage well with their target demographic. Therefore, I have developed some concepts that I feel are more suitable for the elderly and will improve their quality of life.

physiotherapy,"To start I have 5 years of private practice experience and worked in two different countries, average 50 - 70 patients a week.

I've been at my current job for nearly two years now and recently have been really struggling.

The husband and wife owners are very experienced but are very manual handling based.
Acupuncture, cupping and ultrasound are used very frequently. Manual therapy is the preferred treatment method and exercise is patient homework more than an in session treatment. I don't agree with this approach. 

I recently made a mistake giving strengthening exercises a sooner than the surgeon wanted. I gave the exercises at this stage by using a different surgeons guidelines as this surgeon didn't provide any. 
Since this incident I have had 4 messages through our notes system, a 30 minute review with one of the owners, watched a rotator cuff repair with the surgeon (who was super nice and was helpful) and written a reflective statement all in the span of about 3 weeks. 

I was sent the points for my performance review and this patient was brought up again. They want me to have weekly session with either of the owners cause they feel ""I might think I'm doing the right thing but the patient may not feel like I am"". Essentially they think I don't know what I'm doing. 

Over the last 2 years I can't say I've had any major issues other than the bosses expecting manual therapy be provided in every single session. Which honestly I don't do because my clinical reasoning says that's not appropriate for every session. 
One other issue is my follow up to initial patient ratio isn't good enough i.e I need to be seeing more follow up appointments. 


At this stage my confidence is shot, my motivation is at an all time low and I'm at the point where I just pack it in and change career. 

I'm pretty lost, burned out and over it. 

Has anyone else had a similar situation?
