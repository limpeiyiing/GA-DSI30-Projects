physiotherapy,"Hey redditers, 

I'm looking to continue my undergraduate degree (BSc in Medical physics, and just to note it covers a LOT of physiology, anatomy, stats courses covered and can qualify for physio programs in Canada) to a masters in physiotherapy. I've been researching rigorously for universities in Europe, particularly Spain (mostly Madrid and Barcelona). But I feel I've come as I've only found about 3 options, University of cataluya,  Advanced College of Health Sciences of TecnoCampus (Pompeu fabra Uni), and the university of real Madrid (which seems quite ""sketchy"" as they have a ""reservation fee"" for the program of 1500 euro).

I just want to apply to a school in spain with proper accreditations so as to be able to practice physio international (I know there are various tests I will have to take in the future to be properly recognized though) and even open my own practice.

If anyone has information, or school recommendations do mention them! PLS and THANK YOU

physiotherapy,"I know questions surrounding running technique can be controversial but I'm asking this because it *is* a common problem and the research is hard to go through if you're not a running specialist (i.e me).

Question: **For runners that land entirely on their** ***forefoot*** **(**i.e no heel strike at all), **what is the importance of the dorsiflexors? Is weak dorsiflexion less relevant in athletes that don't heel strike?**

On one hand, landing on your forefoot mainly challenges the plantarflexors. As the heel comes down there is indeed a need for dorsiflexion but I never thought of it as active dorsiflexion, it's just eccentric calves is it not?

On the *other* hand, anterior compartment syndrome and anterior tibial stress syndrome still occur in sprinters (who are usually forefoot runners) and EMG studies (sorry I cannot remember them right now) show tibialis anterior is activated throughout most of running regardless of technique.

Answer in whatever way you think is relevant, my main concern is *what are the dorsiflexors actually during running if they're not controlling heel strike?*",What is the importance of dorsiflexion strength in *forefoot* runners?

physiotherapy,"I got a pretty strange dysbalance of back muscles (already visited several physiotherapist so no medical advice needed). Naturally and automatically (e.g. when feeling tense) I use a lot more my right side (starting from the Iliocostalis, to the latisimus and the trapezoid, but not the shoulders). I can't intentionally activate the left side (actually also had that for my left biceps). It only gets activated with some form of resistance but not intentionally...I went several times to physiotherapy because the symptom of this was an extreme tight left shoulder and neck (with pain). However, we discussed mostly the shoulders issues and less the other parts, so at the end they showed me too little of exercises. That's why I am looking for some so I can train to activate each muscle individually. Maybe starting from the right side and step by step de-/activating the next muscle.

physiotherapy,"Third year UK student halfway through an MSK placement just sharing some thoughts.

It's the first time I've worked in an outpatient setting so I've been learning how to manage my diary plus deal with unexpected things (e.g. appointments changing location to another site, patients not getting appointment letters, not having a clinical educator when working at another site, almost a 2 hour commute each way). Not to mention how so much is still done remotely, so I've been adapting my communication skills when assessing over the phone. It's not ideal but I understand that that's just what it's like working in a large trust and am glad to have had this kind of experience. 

That's not to say that I am getting the hang of everything else though. I find the clinical reasoning more challenging than ever. When I do a follow up and read through someone else's notes, I cannot understand how to use the info they've collected. The note might have very fine details about a specific vertebral level which, if I'm honest, freaks me out a little. I feel like anything I read about spines and nerves in the context of patient notes just goes right over my head... and with the added time pressure of keeping to 30 min appointments and having to talk through my reasoning based on those notes to my educator just makes me freeze up and go blank.

Then there's the diagnosis part of things. Perhaps I lack the knowledge or experience to come up with a label for the patient's condition. I struggle with clinical reasoning (like most students I guess!) and find that although I can identify symptoms like muscle weakness and joint instability, I miss more 'serious' things. My clinical reasoning is starting to seem a bit repetitive and basic, and I want to be able to recognise when the symptoms point to something with a more neuropathic presentation, for example. 

I'm going to spend some time going over some common conditions and split them up into groups (myelopathies, arthropathies, neuropathies) to familiarise myself with them. I write reflections but even that isn't helping as much as I'd thought it would, I just find it really hard to identify where the gaps are in my knowledge. I'm on placement with another student who is very vocal about his reasoning which I find is a constant reminder of what I'm struggling with but obviously, we're all working towards different things.

One final thing is that I'm worried that I won't be able to evidence any growth in the second half of my placement. My halfway marks are the lowest they've been, and although I'm told by my educator that this placement is a particularly challenging one it hasn't really been a source of comfort haha.

physiotherapy,"Hi there! I'm a 25 yo. from the US, looking at attending a Physiotherapy program in Greece, proxy of a university in UK. My end goal is to eventually find home somewhere in the EU (Greece would be fine) so I'm not too worried about the fiasco of transferring the degree back to US, I'll deal with that when it comes. 

However, I was hoping to get a familiar set of eyes on the program before I commit. [The program is at the Mediterranean College of Greece, a private college, offering the degree through an academic partnership with the University of Wolverhampton (UK).](https://www.medcollege.edu.gr/courses/bsc-hons-physiotherapy/) Basically I would be a student of Wolverhampton in Greece - there is even an option to attend the graduation ceremony there instead.

So far the college(s) seem to be reputable but the application process has been disconcertingly easy - I was accepted within a day.  My prior education is a US high school diploma and a general associate degree with mostly chemistry courses. 

Coming from the US education system this is setting off a red flag in my mind. There was no entry exam or scrutinizing my transcripts... State side it seems like a 4 year degree is needed before you can take PT or DPT schooling too, not needing that in the UK based program is interesting. 

It says on [Wolverhampton's page](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-physiotherapy/) that the degree is accredited by:

* Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)
* ""Health and Care Professions Council, the (HCPC)""

It looks like I would then have to apply for recognition by the Panhellenic Association of Physiotherapists in Greece after receiving the degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Does the program seem to meet the standards of  BSc physiotherapy study generally?

Is a BSc of Physiotherapy any different in terms of ability than PT school in the states?

Would a masters be required after to be successful in the field?

There are many protocols out there for how to return to running after an injury and whilst they vary hugely, one thing I sometimes see (and something some therapists anecdotally stand by) is putting off running until *strict* strength criteria are met; these approaches attempt to “bulletproof” the lower limb before running even begins.

One example I learnt about during a professional development course by a physio whose name I forgot. They said that the “standard” for plantar flexion strength in runners is “doing 15 single leg bent-knee calf raises with 0.5xbodyweight added.”

The rationale for this is solid - but it’s also a pretty high standard for most. 

Not to mention, slow and heavy calf raises are a completely different beast from the fast, eccentric loads of running.

physiotherapy,"Hi Reddit,

Due to covid we are required to write a systematic review as our dissertation for an MSc I am currently undertaking.

I am the last couple of months trying to come up with a decent topic for a systematic review which hasn't been done recently/before. I guess experimental protocols/lab based research has been put on hold - secondary to covid -  which forced academics to write and publish systematic reviews. This seems to have really restricted options for students like myself.

Anyone have any ideas of reviews that I could possibly write?

physiotherapy,"Hi everyone! I’m struggling to choose between private practise, rehab consultant or Aged care. I was wondering if you could give me some pros and cons about your job, salary and realistic career progression? 

1. Private practise - I’m just scared of getting stuck in a PT mill or burning out physically. I was at a private practise before and I was extremely tired and flared my OA from massage. Most aren’t this bad from what I can gather. 
2. Rehab consultant - I have heard the workplace culture may be toxic and that this would be the end of a career in PT, but Im used to office work and don’t fatigue when I’m working 50+ hours weekly. I love problem solving and managing/ liaising with people. 
3. Aged care - I’m currently on placement and all I’ve been doing is placement and sleep; it is sapping my energy, when I get home I collapse and I’m half asleep when I go the next day. I can’t see myself doing this any longer and my home is a mess and I haven’t been cooking anything since. 

I’m open for other non-clinical physio jobs too. 

Sorry if this doesn’t make sense- I’m half asleep. And I don’t mean to complain, I am probably tired because it takes me more than an hour + 15 min walk to get there as well.",What setting should I work at my first new grad job? (Australia)

physiotherapy,"Hello,

my name is Miha and I'm part of a team that's creating a home-based arm exercising tool that's affordable and very easy to use.

It consists of a mobile application and a small handle that's attached to the mobile device with a magnet, which the user holds.

https://preview.redd.it/4bqzfpwu8yz71.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abb20d410728f747d320ab8556fd8e313324533c

The system contains a combination of exercises/games (wrist, elbow, arm) that guide the user in a challenging way to keep the levels of motivation high**.**  
The dedicated physiotherapist can set the combination of these exercises for a specific user.

The system is meant to be used by people with upper-limb impairments in their home without the medical worker's supervision on daily basis.

The system will also provide information about the user's progress to his dedicated physiotherapist.

&amp;#x200B;

As the mobile device will gather quite a lot of information of exercising session and the information should be monitored by the physiotherapist, here's where your suggestions come in;   
**What information would you be interested in getting as a physiotherapist?**   
(for example: maximum wrist angles, how often the patient exercised, how many (game) points he achieved, progress through time,...)  


If anyone would be willing to learn more, please reach out to me!  
The official release of the mobile application is planned in **January 2022**, but preorders are already possible, so we're quite far with the development.

Good Sunday Morning everyone!

TL;DR: Looking for recommendations (literature and courses) for becoming a PT for a sports team

So right now I’m in my third and final year of PT training/school and I was talking to a friend who’s a professional athlete. Their team is becoming more successful and next year they want to hire a own PT for their players. Typical after/pre-workout treatment on training days, taping before games (yes questionable but it’s what they want) and overlooking the game to assess possible injuries. I would really love to do that since I’m pretty invested into sports myself and think the work is pretty exciting. That brings me to my question; do any of you have experience with such work and/or can someone recommend literature or courses (preferably cut to the German PT education which isn’t a bachelors degree).

2. I don’t know if I’m a good clinician, my exam marks aren’t the greatest (P’s -C’s) and I only get HD’s in practicals. 

3. I love aged care, elderly people and the disability industry but I am highly empathetic and way too caring and I think this is problematic. (Last year I was an allied health assistant and my pt passed away, which absolutely killed me. I cried so much and couldn’t work there anymore, I got depressed). 

3. I’ve been offered numerous new grad jobs which seem great, but I do have an opportunity to branch off my cousins’ NDIS provider business as well. 

4. I’ve been offered multiple private practise jobs and I have connections to multiple business owners. My husbands SIL’s brother has a busy physio clinic near my house too, but I don’t want to work there as he runs a PT mill. 

5. I’m also currently working full time whilst I study, I do marketing (blog writing) business development/ management for my cousins business. I do like it and I’m excelling in this role however my responsibility is huge and I think I burnt out as they have very high expectations and I’ve been working and studying 6-7 days a week for the past year.

physiotherapy,"Hi everyone!
I've been considering for a while moving to the UK and working as a physio (I come from Czech Republic, studied here, currently working in Austria). How is the situation in the post Brexit UK? To be more specific, I mean especially:
How much has changed the recognition process for our job (I'd prefer to hear personal experience - according to hcpc it seems, that the only thing I need is to have a IELTS certificate of a certain level, I have to provide some documentation and I have to pay fee to start the process. Is that really it? No kind of examination of my knowledge etc? As I've gone through a recognition precess in Austria, it was within the EU, so it was kinda supported, to get through the process with ease. I provided my documents, they compared it with their requirements for the education and I only had to make a course of a lymphdrainage. As there is no such international support between the EU and the UK, I fear, that it will be more troublesome.

Another question, what is the situation there for physios? Is it a needed and well paid job? Has it anyhow changed due to Brexit? I focus on orthopaedics, currently working in a rehabilitation centre, and I'd further prefer to work in a similar place rather than in a hospital
