I fell and dislocated my shoulder, got it back into place but it keeps popping out

I don't really have a fitness question, but I see a lot of dislocated shoulder questions here so I hope my post will be allowed and somebody will be able to give me an advice.

So, today while playing soccer, I fell on my outstretched arm and dislocated my left shoulder. I got up, couldn't move my arm, felt some pain when trying to move it. That was around 8:30 pm.

I kneeled down in front of a bench, slowly lifted my left arm, grabbed the far end of the bench and leaned back slowly. It easily popped back in. I put two ice cold water bottles on it for a few minutes. I then changed my sneakers completely normal with both hands, leaning down, tied them up... a few minutes after that my shoulder popped back out while I turned my head and looked over that shoulder. Popped it back in the same way. A few minutes later, I scratched my right shoulder with my left hand and my left shoulder popped back out. I then completely limited my movement and had no mishaps until an hour and a half ago (2.5 hours after the fall). Went to take a shower, tried keeping my left arm perfectly still when I took my tshirt off, and I alouched a bit and it popped back out. So 3 times after the inital fall, in space of 2-ish hours.

Went to the ER in my town, bit they just told me they cannot do anything, can't tell me anything, I need to go to the next city to have a x-ray... I have no one to take me until the morning so here I am. Half past midnight, sleepy as hell, but don't have the courage to lie down.

So my main question is - is it at all normal for a shoulder to keep popping out until the area cools off a bit? Being able to tie my shoes after the fall has me thinking I should be fine, but constant popping afterwards scares me a bit.

I usually slouch quite a lot, so keeping upright is a bit hard for a long time, I get tired and my shoulders then start dropping. Have no idea what to do. It doesn't hurt right now (unless it pops out), so I'm kinda waiting for pain to come in, hoping that would mean it started cooling off and that I'll have more stability in the shoulder.

Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.","Dislocated shoulder keeps popping out after trauma - seeking NO advice, just information"

tl;dr: What are the qualifications/requirements to work as a physio in your country or state?

Since PT in Germany is still a 3 year training at a private or state school working abroad due to academisation in most countries has turned into a difficult process. Many universities offer bachelors degrees which can be done in one year after you finish PT school to be ""internationally qualified"" yet from what I've heard, colleagues who've absolved this ridiculed themselves over how easy it was. I've began to wonder if this really is enough to be qualified as a PT in your countries, where from what I've heard on here the training/study is really intense. Don't get me wrong, PT school in Germany is still not easy and compared to other schoolings should definitely be a degree. Maybe there are some German physios here who can compare...

physiotherapy,"I'm not looking for medical advice, but wanted to get a sense from this community if the doctor was professional or not.

Due to various reasons, I developed pain in 3 different areas that together make it very painful for me to walk for more than 10 mins. I went from easily walking 15k steps per day, to barely making it through 7k. I asked for referrals, but couldnt get to the bottom of the issue with 2 different physiotherapist. My family doctor ended up referring me to a Sports Medicine Doctor. 

I shared my symptoms and issues with the doctor, and told her all the stuff you can read below, and that I think that there is some underlying issue that the physiotherapists are not identifying. I want to get to the root cause of all these issues with my back and legs and develop a preventative routine/approach.

She told me I have too many issues, and western medicine only focuses on one issue at a time. She also said that I overwhelmed her and probably overwhelmed the other physiotherapists and that's why they can't help me. She recommended rehab pilates and other private services that are not covered by the public insurance system. She also suggested to see an osteopath, and said I have some kind of adjustment issue (when leaning back, I lean a bit more to one side). I'm not sure why she wouldn't work with me on a plan..

My questions are:

Is it accurate to say that ""western medicine can't help"" me? My impression is that I go to a doctor, describe my symptoms, and then the professional identifies a common thread or concurrent issues, and we decide on what to address first. It never happened to me that a doctor told me they can't help me because I have ""too many issues"". It ended up being ""too many issues"" because there's a huge backlog in services, and by the time I was able to get an appointment to get a referral or assessment, other issues came up. So by the time I got to her, there were 3 issues instead of 1.

Also, is it true that physiotherapists can only focus on one thing at a time? What if another (related) issue arises from the therapy, or the physiotherapist didn't identify the problem correctly, so the exercises are not effective/create new problems? What if there's a related issue that shows up during the treatment for another issue?

Lastly, any advice how I can organize my description/ approach to be the most effective? I just need someone to figure out why things hurt and how to fix those issues. I need to start exercising to treat other issues I have (the pandemic really messed up my health), and I can't really move forward because everyone just dismisses me.


********

Background for context:

In total, I've seen 5 different physiotherapists over the past 10-12 years, in different provinces, with varying degrees of success, but 4/5 times, I was very satisfied with the service, treatment, and outcome.

In the past 1.5 years, I developed plantar fasciatiis, but I didn't realize it was an issue for the first 4 months. It overlapped with the pandemic + lots of changes in my life, so it took me about 6-8 months to realize there is a problem and need to take care of it. Around the same time, I started feeling some pain in my calf, but I thought it was a random ache (I have a lot of those that end up being nothing). I saw a physiotherapist for a while for the plantar fasciiatis, and the treatment was very helpful but stopped going because of unrelated issues (I actually liked her). I mentioned the pain in my calf, but she just shrugged it off.. so I figured it's one of my random aches.

Other than that, I have an old back injury (unknown source, it just started hurting one day after a hard week at work 12 years ago) that comes back every once in a while. Usually, I would go to a physiotherapist (referral from my family doctor), they would prescribe exercises, and I would be back in shape after a couple of months. Not all the physiotherapists were great, but their methods were fairly consistent (other than the last one I saw).

About 6 months ago, I had a weird COVID-like onset of symptoms that included severe back and leg pain, fever, etc. It ended up being a viral throat infection. Since then, I'm having a flair up of my back pain (sciatica). I went to a different physiotherapist (different than the one who treated plantar fasciatiis). I didn't like that physiotherapist's approach and she was giving unprofessional advice, and stopped seeing her. I also mentioned the calf pain and she also shrugged it off. That's how I ended up with a referral to the sport medicine doctor, who was also unhelpful.","[Ontario, Canada] A Sports Medicine Doctor told me I have too many problems and western medicine can't help me. does that make sense?"

physiotherapy,"I'll preface this with the fact that I am from Australia, and that I am not looking for medical advice. 

I have had some upper back problems for around 3 to 4 years now, and am losing all hope of ever returning to normal.

For some backstory, my injury came seemingly out of nowhere. I hadn't been working for maybe 6 months, and was doing no hard physical activity at the time. I woke up in the morning, and bam, it was there. Obviously I slept on it wrong. 

In the last 3-4 years, I have been to so many different physio's, also sport therapists, myotherapy and just about any other type of therapy I could think of. Mainly physio's though, as I am of the understanding that physio is evidence and science based.

It seems every physio I go to, they do the exact same thing which doesn't seem to be doing anything. They have all tried to associate my injury to my current job, which I inform them that I wasn't doing before the injury, and I wasn't doing when the injury occurred. It always starts with ""ok, now cross your arms on your chest and put your hands on your shoulders. and now roll forward. ok, now bend back. Now, hands on shoulders and elbows out, and bend to the side. Now the other side."" These exersizes (or examinations) rarely engage or stretch the muscles that I feel that have been cramped up for the last 3-4 years (if they do, it's only a tiny bit). ""now how does that feel?"" to which I usually reply ""yeah, not too bad"" Or ""yeah I can feel it a bit in that sore spot I told you about""

They will then get me on the bed thing on my stomach, do some massage (sorry I don't know the proper term) or pressing around my spine to loosen up the muscles around my spine, then give me some exercizes to do at home. 

Always after the physical manipulation on the bed thing, they run me through the same stretching examination as at the start and say ""oh the movement is so much better!"" in my head I'm thinking 'bullshit, it's exactly the same and my back is still sore'.

They then rebook me for a week, explain that we will do weekly sessions until I see improvement at which time we will start to do fortnightly or monthly maintenance appointments. 

I then do the exersizes, come back weekly until THEY decide I have improved and we can start to do fortnightly or monthly sessions. Meanwhile, my back is still exactly the same, and they have not even touched the muscles that are causing me so much grief. 

Why do they seemingly refuse to touch the muscles that are causing me pain? I am absolutely dying for someone to just get their thumbs or elbow into the offending muscles. When I do it myself with a squash ball, it actually does help, but I feel like someone that has studied human anatomy should be able to do a better job than a rubber ball. Are these physio's just rubbish?

Anyway, this turned into a long post, and I'm sorry for any physio's in here that might think ""oh, he's one of *those* clients"". I'm not sure, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I just don't know why they all do the exact same thing, and call me fixed when nothing changes. To me it seems like it should be simple, just get in there and loosen up the part that hurts, but I'm not a physio so I could only assume I'm wrong. Also I'm sorry if this comes off as a rant, but I'm at my whits end because of this pain, and I feel like I don't even know what to do any more.",Am I just going to rubbish Physio's?

Currently my clinic’s split for employees is on the low-mid 40’s to start with, while contractors start at 50. I don’t know if this is what is around the area, but am struggling to see the benefit of employee vs being a contractor is other than CPP and EI contributions if the difference in split is that much (+ only 5 paid sick days in a year). My employer sounds like they prefer employees to contractors though, and was trying to convince me that being an employee is better than contractor. I’ve been doing the math and it’s just not really adding up. And i’m not sure how much we can write off with tax too if I’m an employee.

physiotherapy,"Hi guys,

I'm an YORKU undergrad student who graduated couple years ago. I couldn't apply right away, and recently I finally applied to Australia UofQ.

I am trying to figure out post-life in CANADA after graduating AUS university. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is....

Is the PCE exam (including the practical exam) difficult to pass. I don't know how to measure ""difficulty"", as it can be a very subjective thing. 

Maybe, i guess out of GPA 4.0 scale, how was your 'perceived difficulty', to pass PCE EXAM (written&amp;practical) and the credentialing process? 

Right now, I'm hesitating to decide whether or not to go physiotherapy school outside of CANADA, just because, I feel like i won't be competitive enough for PCE exam. (As I'm going to be competing with PTs from Canada schools). 

Knowing that I'll have to compete with Canadian students at the end of the road (for PCE exam), I'm not sure if it makes sense to go AUS, since I wasn't already competent to get into Canadian school.

Am I over thinking too much? I'm just uncertain with everything at the moment.

(Brief background info, For last 3 years of my undergrad, I got all A's except one course. I messed up early years, that's why i couldn't get into Canadian school). 

I'd really appreciate for your input.","[Canada] Anybody here graduated Australia physiotherapy school, currently practicing in Ontario?"

physiotherapy,"23F, Europe. I recovered from an eating disorder a couple of years ago, but my core is still very weak, so when I do ab exercises, I overcompensate with my back (I think?) and the muscles in my lower back starts hurting like crazy pretty much immediately.

Maybe some exercises where it would be impossible for your back to overcompensate?

physiotherapy,"So l have a background in MMA and complementary strength training, where form is basically everything. lf l can't perform a deadlift with good form l can't lift a person with good form in order to wrestle them down. During my placements as a student l always took pride in making sure my patients had really good form for them to function as good as possible (probably a bit of projection of my own needs). Furthermore l was quite upset how my school thought it'd be taught in a weekend workshop (even worse with those two idiots in charge....), because strength training is something you learn by numerous repetitions, not by trying it once.   

  

Now after a few weeks as a licensed PT l see a lot of colleagues' patients in the gym, doing various exercises in what l would call ""free form"", AKA doing exercises void of form.

physiotherapy,"Hi guys!   I haven’t been on this subreddit for a while which I am very proud of as it did become quite addictive to keep asking for reassurance- but I am well and truly stuck on what to do next.   For context, 7-8 months ago, I damaged my hamstrings. Whenever I would cross my leg and then extend my leg, it would make a popping sound and it got progressively worse to the point I couldn’t crouch without it popping and not being able to walk for a few days. The worst experience was when it popped, could not put my weight on the leg and was unable to fully extend my leg for up to 48 hours.   I’ve been to my physio on three occasions in which they told me I’ve just got really tight hamstrings which has caused tendinitis. I was sent home with knee exercises which I’ve been doing for the last 8 months.   My leg feels so much stronger and I am able to sit cross legged but won’t sit in the position for too long due to, you guessed it ✨anxiety✨.   The problem is this has caused such a mental block, I just refuse to sit on the ground, to crouch or to move my leg in a position I feel it would cause that feeling again. So I’ve now just stopped living and doing the things I loved to do. I use to love doing yoga - no longer do it, I use to love sitting on the floor to play with my younger family members, I can’t even enjoy sunbathing on a beach towel purely down to just being so anxious.

physiotherapy,"tl;dr - I heard from a few people that PTs start off at a low wage, around 50k, and it can take years and years before even reaching 75k salary. Is this true? How fast does it take to build a name and get more clients?

This is my first time posting here so not too sure what to expect, but I am going into my fourth year of Health Sciences in Ontario, Canada. I have been thinking about pursuing physiotherapy for a while now and finished all the prerequisites for most schools across Canada, and my GPA for the last 2 years is around 8.8/10 (\~3.86/4). One of my coworkers at my current job (not physio-related) told me his brother is struggling to make good money as a PT and it just made me want to ask about salary. I know PTs usually start off with a lower salary and build up over time, but he told me that his brother has been working for over 3 years and still wasn't making over $60,000 CAD. I talked to his brother too and he said that it can take years to build up a name and for people to request appointments with you so that you have more clients and therefore make more money. It kind of bummed me out because my brother is a nurse making around 80k which requires less school, and since I work at a pharmacy, I know a lot about their career path and it takes around the same amount of school (maybe a year or two more) but multiple pharmacists have told me that you start at around 90k. 

I know money is not everything but I plan to get married soon and if you are from Canada you know renting and house prices are just insane now, so I just want to know if this is really true. One of the pharmacists told me that he knows someone who stopped working in PT clinics and just got a government job because it was paying more. I truly do want to work in a clinic and provide great service to people in need, but I don't want to do a Masters and end up not making enough to move out, let alone take care of a wife and kids.

physiotherapy,"Hi! I hope this is an ok question to ask. Where I live, you need a doctor's precription for physio appointments to be covered. I'm feeling more and more doubtful about the doctor's recs (he's a sports doctor who says he's very familiar with my issue, but his recomendations go against a bunch of more recent recommendations I've read in reputable publications - to give an idea, he wanted me in a brace ""24/7"" for 6 weeks with an ankle sprain (grade 2 tear) and doesn't want me to do any proprioception, balance or strengthening excercises ""until it's all healed up"", and he only ok'd back and forth range of motion exercises a full month into the injury, no circles or any lateral movement, even though there's no pain.)

He wants me to wait even longer to get a prescription to start physio, but I'm not sure how comfortable I feel about his recomendations, plus he's expensive and at this point it'd be cheaper to pay for a couple physio sessions out of pocket than pay for yet another 5 minute consultations where he tells me to wait and not do anything. But I'm not sure if a physio would be ok with me going against a doctor's recomendations. Also, I think this doctor is like this because he's not that young - would it be a good idea to look for a more recently graduated physio?

I'm nearing a 2 year prolonged leave of absence, following the development of a quite debilitating social/generalized anxiety/panic disorder with associated agoraphobia.
