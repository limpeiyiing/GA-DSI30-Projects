physiotherapy,"Hi,

I graduated from physio at the start of this year. 

Since then I have been working in a private practice in Sydney.

I love the kind of patients I get to help in the private practice environment but have started to feel burnt out because of the demands from this kind of an environment. I have started to wonder if physio is something I want to do long-term too.

At the moment, I am considering going into aged care physio but am unsure if there's going to be a need for aged care physio's after the changes happen to ACFI in October later this year.

Just wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom, thanks!",Private Practice to Aged Care Physio - Sydney

physiotherapy,"Hello All,



Just want to state before we start I have absolutely no knowledge on physiotherapy, however I am asking this question in an attempt to be able to understand my friends situation more.


My friend has exhuast 2/3 of  their PCE exam attempts, I am confident in their skill &amp; knowledge, they scored 575 in their most recent attempt, they work extremely hard, this is not only their chosen career path but also their life's passion. 


Anyways, question is, what happens after 3 attempts?
 Can they go back to school and try again? 
Are there any exceptions? 
What options are out there for people who failed all 3 attempts?

physiotherapy,"I'm planning on applying to 3 physio schools in Ontario this fall, UofT, Western, and McMaster. I'm in a healthcare field (nutrition and dietetics) but didn't seriously consider PT until about a year ago, so I didnt get the psych prereqs for alot of other schools in Canada.

My subGPA is looking like it'll be around 3.9, which I'm pretty comfortable with. But I don't have much direct physio experience. I have experience coaching and doing nutrition counselling for martial arts, some social media stuff for private dietetics firms, and some experience working with the dietary staff at a LTC home (where I first got interested in rehab). I also have some experience developing workshop/seminars about HIV/AIDS, concussion identification for softball players, and posture tips to avoid MSK disorders when working from home.

physiotherapy," 

Do I have bicep tendonitis or Brachialis Tendinopathy ?

Sorry, not sure where to put this but I really need help:

Hi, I really need help. I have had pain under my bicep for ages now. It has been 6-7 Months. The pain has gotten better but the pain is still present but progress has officially stopped . I have stopped weight training for 6-7 months now and its causing me distress and depression (a bit over the top I know).

I have been to my local GP and they have stated it is muscle over use. I was prescribed a few stretches to do to alleviate the pain but it still has not gone (again, doing this for 6-7 months) I have been using hot water bottles on it 2-3x a day. Its getting ridiculous. I feel as though the GP is just saying its muscle overuse but they may not understand that it could be something deeper. To Note: the physotherapist states it is also muscle overuse.

I just do not want to have this for another 7 months. I do not believe it is bicep tendonitis as, correct me if i am wrong, but I do not have pain shooting from my shoulders or elbow. It only appears to be under my bicep. Looking Online, I have come across Brachialis Tendinopathy which seems to be what I am feeling? Please can someone help I am stressed and wake up disheartened everyday as although, it may not be that deep, the only thing I enjoy is the Gym. Its been a sad 7 months. To note: I am not a rock climber nor do any other sports but go to the gym. I also was working retail at the time.

I have enclosed a few pictures to show where the pain is.. Dont judge the smallness of my arms it has been 6-7 months.

Please let me know if you need any questions or more pictures.

I have already been through 15 sessions of physiotherapy and have been self managing a physical therapy excersise program since that relationship ended. 

The physical therapy program has not been helpful at reducing or improving my pain levels and what I do consistenly results in flare ups of high pain levels and difficulties with being able to participate in group fitness classes or independent gym routines 

I am very devoted to my self management and recovery its just I feel something is not right with what I am doing currently and I need advice to make changes so it's more beneficial. 

I wonder how can I be most helpful as a client with the way I communicate and the information I provide to my new physiotherapist? 

I will bring a chart of what I have tried, what flares pain and what helps alleviate it, what functions and activities trigger pain levels increasing, a description of the feeling of pain as I experience it, pain levels baseline and when flared. I am trying to be very succinct here to make the most of the time.

I'm sure my new phsyio knows what she is doing! I have just felt frustrated in the past and concerned I haven't been heard, so I want to know if I can make any adjustments to my communication style or the information I present.

physiotherapy,"I'm Canadian and I've been injured. I completely believe that with *a lot* of physiotherapy, that's more akin to what a professional athlete would be provided, I could be rehabilitated. Maybe not fully, but at least to the point of being able to take on a labour intensive job if need be. The problem is that there's huge cost that goes with that amount of rehabilitation when one half an hour session, that's more like 20 minutes, costs $60 CAD. The model of physio in Canada seems to be centred around workers compensation insurance to get a patient out as fast as possible without full fledge rehabilitation. 

I've been trying to explore the idea of going to somewhere like Thailand, South America, China, or India to see if I can get the full standard of care instead of an expensive twenty minute session that might result in a few physio exercises with a band, some talk, and ultrasound. Every time I pitch this idea I get the feeling that the physiotherapists in Canada believe their standard of education is so much higher that what I'm pitching is a totally terrible idea that would result in me getting hurt. Is this true? 

I'm literally looking for a physiotherapist that can be more involved and carry me through training to the point where I recover.

physiotherapy,"In short, should physios need to consider the importance of nutrition when treating musculoskeletal issues in private practice, in particular when increasing strength?

My supervisor and I discussed this and we thought of the obvious example of stress fractures in dancers and marathon runners. It's well accepted that calcium intake must be screened in these people, especially since restrictive diets are common amongst them.

What about muscular weakness however? Personal trainers and exercise physiologists rightfully stress the basic need for increased (somewhat) protein intake to build significant amounts of muscle over long periods and an energy surplus is typically assumed.

Is there a point where we need to consider this in private practice? My supervisor and I had these basic points:

**Reasons in favour:**

* In older populations, addition of protein supplements (usually whey) has been shown to improve muscle gained/preserved relative to resistance training alone
* In athletic populations, the standard for strength is very high and energy needs are high. There *may* be cases wherein poor nutrition/recovery undoes or limits the effectiveness of our resistance training rehab.

**Reasons against:**

* Only a small proportion of patient problems are *purely* strength-related
* In more sedentary populations, the strength gains needed to make significant progress will be mostly or almost entirely due to *neurological* changes, not hypertrophy and thus, less dependent on energy balance and protein intake
* Nutrition is beyond our scope of practice. Referral to a dietician is easy in a hospital but may be less practical in private practice.
* Most studies looking at resistance training for common musc issues (knee/hip OA, tendinopathy) do not control for diet yet yield good results.

My general conclusion thus far is that it worth investigating diet in high-level athletes or those requiring restrictive diets - however these people likely already have nutritional oversight.

physiotherapy,"Context: I’m in my first year out of uni as a private practice musculoskeletal physio in Australia. I’ve lived out of home since I was 18, never really had much or been able to save up. 

I started my first job several months ago. The clinic seemed amazing, the interview went well with my now boss who seemed much like the physio I would want to develop into.

The contract I am on is set up with this incredibly low day rate and then I am paid per patient. Kind of like a contractor but I was asked to work full time. I asked around and got mixed responses about this being normal. Some others said it was unfair, even predatory, for a new grad to be expected to be paid per patient. 

I ended up accepting it because the opportunity seemed worth it and my boss stated that the patient numbers would steadily increase and I would be well supported after a few months. 

Once I started working there were some preparatory strategies, but very little structured professional development. Basically just shadowing. This was for about a week and a bit then for the most part I was asked to do every odd job. Random admin, social media work, website design, marketing, doctor letters. My patient numbers increased but slowly and I was consistently told to improve my rebooking strategies. 

This went on for nearly three months, my time completely filled with nonphysio tasks. Occasional chats with my boss, mostly about improving rebooking. I worked hard to show my worth. 

It reached the end of probation and I asked my boss to increase my pay rate (the other physios mentioned they were getting more than double, and asked I be raised to that). Boss declined and offered me a different rate, that seemed better. I accepted, but realised it actually paid worse so I asked the next day to return to the previous rate. I told my boss I would have to cut my hours, would no longer complete the random assortment of tasks unless compensated to do so and that I would look for more supplementary work until the patient load supported me better. 

Boss agreed to this but then paid me the worse rate which I had to bring up at work. If your not keeping count this is the fourth chat about pay rates. The boss also docked the bonus I was normally paid since then. 

Finally, last week I did a twenty minute Google to find out if the pay rate was legal. Turns out I was paid at less than 60% of MINIMUM wage for nearly 6 months (including ‘bonuses’) and the contract was completely illegal. Also, Employees are not expected to take on financial risks, that’s the employers role. I called a government agency to check and they confirmed it and told me to make a written request for pay owed within 7 days to my boss. If my boss didn’t comply I would escalate it to the government agency where the penalties were $10,000 to 60,000 for just one of the offences. 

I tried to calmly raised the issues with my boss using the guidelines from the government agency. They felt they had supported me fairly and that based on everything so far I was not cut out for private practice and should work in government. I told my boss I strongly disagreed. They said they needed to think about my request and would make some calls. 

I didn’t mention the penalties or that I would be making a written request for the pay out of courtesy. 

I honestly don’t want to have to escalate it or report them to any physio organisations. They employs a great team of physios, have a lovely family and the clinic helps a lot of people. 

Am I overreacting? Is this pay structure common? 

I really don’t know what to do. Open to any and all suggestions. 

TLDR: new grad physio paid 60% of minimum wage, unable to negotiate, boss reduced pay repeatedly and now I’m escalating it but I’m not sure whats best to do.",Being paid well below minimum wage. Is this normal?? I’m having disputes with my boss. I don’t know what to do.

physiotherapy,"Hello everyone! 

Upcoming Ontario graduate here and I've gotten a number of offers and am debating between two to start right now, and I was hoping for some input :)

1) private practice: 
- 4 minute drive from home 
- 4 day workweek (flexible hours, 4 9s probably)
- Smaller practice with few MVA and WSIB
-  50% fee split *employee* status, so CPP/taxes/EI/4% vacation will be paid
- 12-16 patients per day with a wait list into September, so relatively steady and busy 
- 37.50 to start for 3 months if I don't want a fee split immediately 
- 1000$ education fund 
- health spending account (I think $1000)
- 2 weeks vacation for year 1, up to 3 in year 2, and 4 weeks after 5 years
- 4 additional unpaid professional development days 
- I don't know if there's a ton of opportunity for formal mentorship or anything since it's a very small practice/team 
- own laptop to chart and basically my own treatment room since there aren't a bunch of clinicians bouncing around 

2) private practice but MOH funded clinic 
- 45 minute commute 
- did a placement there so I'm familiar with it 
- contracted employee 
- $44 per hour 
- $1500 education fund 
- $1500 health spending account 
- 4 day workweek, flexible with which days off I want
- unlimited unpaid vacation (CPP/EI/taxes/4% vacation not paid)
- connections to family health team in same building which could allow for development of new programs and such (which I would like to do) 
- I don't know if there is a formal mentorship program 
- occasionally I noticed on placement that treatment rooms would sometimes be unavailable because there's lots of clinicians, and they chart on paper, and there aren't formal ergonomic desks and chairs to do charting 
- wouldn't have my own computer or laptop to do work

It's my first job and really I'd like to get into some type of research and program development down the way, maybe transition to acute care at some point, so I believe that I won't be staying in private practice for more than 5-6 years (unless something really changes). My life dream is *not* to own a clinic so I'm not looking for substantial leadership and growth to get to partnership or anything.

Any thoughts? Would you commute for the second offer? Any opinions on fee splits?

The second offer has much more flexibility for vacation and life, but the first one is much closer to home and lets me be an employee and get those government perks.

physiotherapy,"I have been in physiotherapy for two months now. I started after a car accident. I had all over back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, pain at the base of my head, and they are treating me for headaches and jaw pain too.

For headaches and jaw pain they are just doing laser.

For my lower back the do tens and usually the laser and have done ultrasound maybe twice.

For my shoulders they use the tens machine and ultrasound.

My neck they've really done next to nothing for...same wuth the base of my head. But they started booking me for massage which helps my neck slightly. I have only had one massage appointment, but the PT does some massage each session  anyway.

Now my issue is, I was feeling over all better until the Tueday before last. When I rolled over in my sleep, not sure what happened or why, but my shoulder got hurt. I had PT that day and brought it up because my shoulder was hurting more than it did directly after the accident. So they decided to focus the tens on my one shoulder rather than both which is fine. She also said that it was my neck, and that she was going to stretch out my neck. She did a little massage on the area, which she hadn't been doing before, and kind of pulled up on it a bit while I was laying on  my back. Then she had me sit in a chair so she could ""stretch out my neck."" She grabbed my head at my jaw and pulled on it pretty hard. Then asked me to turn my head to one side and did it again, then the other side and did it again. This hurt, and did not feel good. It gave me zero release.

I have only seen anything like it, in videos of chiropractors when they are adjusting people, and you hear cracks. There were  no cracking sounds when  she did it, but it felt like she was just mimicking something she saw a chiropractor do, and like she shouldn't have been doing it. The office has a sign up that they are looking for a new chiropractor and don't currently have one... maybe that's why.

I was in WAY more pain when I left that day then when I got there. I have also been in pain non stop since. My neck is hurting really bad constantly, and my shoulder is hurting like crazy. It takes hours to fall asleep because sleeping on the side of my painful shoulder is unbearable....sleeping on the other side still causes that shoulder to hurt, and it's hard and still painful to sleep on my back. Sleeping on my back also hurts my neck, but it's the best for my shoulder, although still extreamly painful.

physiotherapy,"Hi all  
I'm an avid cricket and football player although recently i am experiencing this one really weird and painful injury that comes and goes.  
Warning: it's hard to describe hence not finding any solutions in google  
Essentially, when I bowl in cricket im putting a lot of stress onto my front foot (left foot) when i land, very frequently after a ball it feels as though something solid like a metal rod is running from my little toe to just before my ankle (obviously there is nothing there and must be a muscle doing something), it is extremely painful and the weirdest part is that i can completely get rid of it by taking off my shoe and cracking/bending the knuckle on my little toe. Although it's great that i can fix it, it's difficult to do this in the middle of a match and sometimes the crack just wont happen so i have to run around uncomfortably for a while until it does. I know the explanation isn't amazing, but if anyone could suggest a proper name for what's happening or even any solutions if possible

When does a physio reach the ideal “Patient mileage” where they can diagnose with ease.

I hear often a saying once you’ve reached your patient mileage you can do this, once you’ve reached patient mileage you can easily pick up things etc etc.

I injured my lower back (pain around the tailbone area, right above bumhole) 9 weeks ago, and it's still not gone or going away/getting better.

When I lie down on my stomach on a flat surface, my bed for example, and then try to do some leg curls where I try to hit my butt with my feet, I get a sharp pain in that tailbone/lower back area.

Just want to get back into lifting so bad... :( Already lost so much progress for not wanting to lift in pain which has resulted in me not going.

My conjecture is that because the left arm/shoulder is used less (most people have a dominant right arm), the connective tissues surrounding the joint is weaker, and hence it is more prone to dislocation. I would also assume that there’s more muscle imbalances in the left shoulder.

physiotherapy,"Like many, I've dabbled in a bit of aged care over the pandemic - easy daytime money provided you close your eyes to ACFI's failings/make it work for you!

Obviously with AN-ACC coming in and rising overheads, it seems a no-brainer that sites are going to reduce as many Allied Health expenditures as they can - likely either with Lifestyle, AHA's, or AINs/PCA's doing the massage/walking. Wouldn't be suprised if some of the smaller sites share a single AHP rather than having a 4-days weekly dedicated site PT/OT. 

I've got mixed feels on this as can still see a 4x weekly physio for most sites adding a lot of value if allowed to do *real* physio work, but can also see a lot of aged care physios potentially struggling with this unless they've had some private/community experience, and a lot of facility managers concentrating on their financial bottom lines/making calls based on ACFI-based AHP work they've seen for years. 

I'm anticipating lots of aged care physios to start bailing ship over Aug-Sep; perhaps earlier if they're smart/before all the NDIS spots fill up (I think it'd be a tough for aged care physios to transition into private practice).
