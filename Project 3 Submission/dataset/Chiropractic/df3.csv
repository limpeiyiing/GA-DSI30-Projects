Chiropractic,"**Hey everyone, I am wondering if any alumni / current students ever transferred schools in the middle of their program?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to read my post below but if not no worries I am mostly curious about my question above.

&amp;#x200B;

I am finishing up Tri 2 at Parker University with excellent grades and good friends. I am a veteran and the school is a part of the 'yellow ribbon program' which means I have the first 7 tri's out of 10 for free until my GI bill runs out (this is the reason I chose Parker) The remainder of tuition with rent / cost of living is around **85k total debt.**

 My girlfriend and I moved to Dallas from small towns in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho. We didn't visit before sending the move here and it has been absolutely brutal moving into this huge city. I won't get into details about it but my girlfriend doesn't think she can live here anymore, especially for 3 more years. I think I would be fine finishing school here but it is not ideal and would have to sacrifice a lot. And our relationship with terminate. **Suddenly here comes another opportunity for me.**

My family is a chiropractic family and have 15 alumni family members who went to Palmer along with my grandfather who was a long time professor as well as the dean of Palmer while BJJ was still alive and active at school, Dr. Frogley. My mom was at an alumni meeting and brought up my situation. Of course the Palmer rep proposed me transfering to Palmer and set up communication with me. (the reason I chose Parker initially is because of the free school)

Palmer doesn't have as great of a partnership with the VA as Parker does so my tuition would be significantly higher. I haven't crunched numbers yet so I'm not sure the cost difference. However I pay **$1700 in rent in dallas for a 1 bedroom apartmen**t. In Iowa I could buy a house and have a mortgage around or even lower than **$800 per month**. We could have a yard, could garden, have chickens, could keep my 93 classic dodge ram, and enjoy our lives MUCH more. We both are very uncomfortable living in dallas and despise the lifestyle here. 

I haven't pursued anything yet with this transfer but **I am wondering if anybody has done this / how was their experience? Did the school take your credits / classes that you already took in the previous DC program?**

I am also curious on people's opinions of Parker vs Palmer. **Especially the curriculum.** 

Thanks",Transfering Chiropractic Schools?
Chiropractic,"So basically had an minor accident at work and went to a chiropractor within a few days due to upper back pain on my left side from an injury to my neck.

After looking up a few reddit posts on what to look out for in a bad chiro, I have found they have done the following:

-Done a x ray and then followed up with a report with bunches of lines pointing out bad curvatures and even a number for the amount of extra weight which I was putting on my neck due to bad posture. 

-Asked if I had been in a car accident before.

-Tried an upfront payment which i declined.

-Every session has been the same adjustments and I’m  out within 15 minutes.

My right side has always been fine, which I’m now in pain to what I think was one of my sessions and I’ve been having bad headaches as well to the point where I’m getting a mri done tomorrow.

I will no longer be going however I am worried that I have serious neck issues, mainly due to this “number” of extra weight which is apparently putting extra strain on my neck. Should I be worried or is this just a scare tactic?","I think I’ve been seeing a bad Chiropractor, what should I do now?"

i've been having a pretty scary symptom lately after getting adjusted at the chiropractor and i want to know if anyone else had this issue. 
so i went to an upper cervical chiropractor on June 15th and was told i have a misaligned atlas. i've gotten two adjustments so far and i've been having this weird symptom of whenever i bend my chin down towards my chest i get this rush in my head and in my body. like a lightheadedness but not the same as when you stand up and get lightheaded it's an uncomfortable sensation to say the least. 
i also experience muscle twitching in my neck and head along with the rest of my body. 
i talked to two different chiropractors and they both said this was normal and it's my muscles / nerves getting used to the new placement in my body. my neck muscles feel looser than they used to when i would try to stretch my neck when they were very tight.

Chiropractic,"Hello folks! I wrote about a month ago when I was about a month into seeing a chiropractor and I had an awful adjustment that my body reacted to. It was corrected later and I didn’t feel the sick symptoms I had that night, but A whole bunch of new things have happened. In a nutshell my body appears to be doing fascial unwinding on its own and I also feel like all my bones or joints are very unstable, and I just have absolutely no idea what kind of doctor to go to or who is supposed to be helping me or answering questions. The backstory is below, I apologize in advance that it is lengthy but I beg anybody to please at least point me in the right direction or offer any insight you may have.


about a week after my last post and a few hours after doing a new morning yoga stretch that kept me in the position for a bit longer than usual, my body started doing this involuntary movement that I gave into and ended up rotating different limbs for hours. For a few days I kept googling trying to understand what the hell was happening because it felt like a ribbon unwinding in my body And even opening up some new space, but I didn’t know what it was. Eventually landed on fascial unwinding which I had never heard of and everything I have read thus far implies that people only do it when they are manipulated by a myofascial release therapist. For the first week or two I would have to give in to the little wave that I could feel in my body but after that I started waking up in the middle of the night unwinding for hours on end. But I still don’t see a difference aside from one night a crease literally opened up in my stomach that must have been crushed from me being slumped in poor posture. (From what I have learned about the fascial layer it hardens or twists because of bad posture, chronic stress, and sedentary lifestyle… All three of which I participated in for over a year during the pandemic.)

I am now almost 2 months into going to the chiropractor and not only do I not feel like anything in my body improved but I feel like my bones are literally floating. Like when I do a downward dog position for example, I sit back down afterward and I can literally feel like my entire rib cage or something come back down from being all the way up from my shoulders. And my body will slightly move as it’s settling back in its place. I feel so unstable like if I even leaned on my side for a bit that all my bones would fall to that side. I slept with my head on the pillow and neck hanging off the other night And woke up with my collarbone feeling either flipped or caved in and a bone sticking out of place in my shoulder creating a bump. The chiropractor said I put two bones out of place.

I had been going to a chiro who does the gonstead method and at one point switched to someone else because the first guy only was seeing me once a week and not explaining much and I felt that I should probably be seen more than that based on what people say. Definitely got caught up in one of the pre-payment plan overzealous generic crackhouse kind of places and did 12 seemingly useless sessions and now I’m back to my old guy. I also saw a myofascial release therapist and it seemed to make my mood better but all three of these people cannot seem to answer my questions or provide me a thorough explanation of what is happening to me or why. The therapist told me it’s good that I am unwinding but didn’t offer any further info. The crackhouse chiropractor told me I am 1 in 1000 for unwinding on my own and offered me some YouTube videos of chiropractors manipulating their patients for the unwind, but also gave me zero other info. Why the hell do my bones feel like they are floating? Am I getting messed up more? Is this a part of the process? I truly don’t understand what is happening and I am so frustrated with the lack of knowledge. My brother’s girlfriend is in med school to be an osteopath and suggested I see an osteopath who specializes in osteopathic manipulative medicine. I found someone who does that and acupuncture that I will see in two weeks and perhaps they will give me some type of info.

If you didn’t see my last post, the reason I went to a chiropractor is because I have been dealing with stomach bloating and gurgling issues for over a year. Tried a million docs and tests and went to a chiropractor who gave me an x-ray and we found that my neck curves the opposite way, my shoulders are tilted and my hips are tilted the other way from my shoulders .

I will say my stomach issues have been mainly gone during these last two months aside from when I get an uncomfortable adjustment that would bring it back until the next adjustment, but since messing up my shoulders I have been dealing with my stomach issues all week. I also want to mention that one adjustment last week I was feeling numb and tingly in different ligaments and at one point my entire legs felt like they were fully filled with concrete. I have explained this info to both chiropractors and have asked multiple times if they are sure it is OK I can be adjusted and they keep saying yes and adjusting me. I have no idea if I should stop or not and I just need help please y’all",Fascial unwinding happening involuntarily + bones feel like they’re floating kind of

Chiropractic,So my girlfriend has pretty bad lower back pain and seems to only feel relief when I put a lot of weight on her tailbone. Due to this I suggested she see a chiropractor because while I do think they try and oversell how effective they are there are definite cases they can be very helpful and I figured it was worth a shot. Anyway she goes and they take X-rays and tell her that she has a straight neck( what I’ve also seen as military neck) and that if she doesn’t get it corrected she will very likely( according to them 96%) have degenerative bone problems later in life. She told me that her chiropractor asked her if she was a C-section baby and she said she was and according to him that is the cause of her straight neck. The thing is she has no neck pain/problems which I thought it a little weird the chiropractor decided to focus in on that when she does have really bad lower back pain and that’s why she came in the first place. So not only is my question can a C-section actually cause a straight neck but also if she has no pain does it matter.,Can C-sections cause a straight neck?

I am someone who loves the idea of creating rehabilitation plans and monitoring clients through their exercise plans.

Chiropractic,"An in-house mental health clinician is something that really appeals to me, but since it doesn't seem to be very prevalent I'm assuming there are things about it that don't work. Counseling resources are dire these days, so it'd be interesting to see if a one-stop shop model could work. There are already plenty of practices that meet the social/community building  prong, like those that do a lot of successful classes or events and maybe those that are attached to a gym/crossfit. And certainly there are federally qualified facilities in mainstream medicine that do wrap-around supports in this way, but they are abysmally under-resourced and have so many stipulations tied to their funding. In a private practice it would seem easier to implement, given that (I believe) commercial health insurance plans must cover both mental health and chiropractic to be Affordable Care Act compliant. 

Outside of that I could see worksheets/educational materials serving a purpose, but maybe too much of a half-measure. Motivational interviewing helps, but it takes time to build that skill, and of course it would be out of scope to venture into real trauma territory. 

Expecting radio silence as always, but I'd be glad to hear about anything exciting people are doing in this realm! Or failed attempts/learning experiences.

Chiropractic,"I’m curious if there are chiro’s out there that rarely if ever do manual manipulations and primarily utilize exercise based interventions. Obviously spinal manipulations are part of the profession, but I personally see a ton of value in using knowledge of biomechanics, tissue loading, motor control/learning etc. to improve patient outcomes and ultimately try to address the root cause of pain/discomfort.",Are there non-manipulation based practitioners?

Chiropractic,"Hello everyone,

I hope you’re doing well!   So I’m currently a high school teacher but having this burning desire to join the health care profession.  I love my chiropractor, all he’s done for me, and seemed to have great quality of life.  I don’t have debt and maxed out my credit with a decent pension.  My questions are:  Does it seem worth it?  I have a learning disability so is chiro school a doable feat?  How hard I school?

Thank you!",Career Change to Chiro
Chiropractic,"Oregon provider seeing a patient who lives in Oregon but was rear-ended in California. When I scheduled him as a new patient I didn’t know he had retained counsel in California. Last time we dealt with an out of state accident where lawyers were involved, we received zero reimbursement for an entire episode of care. 

Can we go back to the patient and his attorney and ask that his assignment of benefits to them be rescinded in order for us to keep treating? It doesn’t make sense to me why PIP coverage/MedPay funds would need to be diverted to the law firm instead of paid directly to medical providers for care. Isn’t that coverage completely separate from whatever BS settlement this person may or may not get? 

I’m not familiar with the laws in California, or whether they apply to this scenario. In Oregon you file a claim with your auto carrier, receive medical care, your carrier pays the provider, and then your carrier gets reimbursed by the at-fault driver’s carrier. It’s very straightforward. 

We don’t see many car accident cases in general, so I’m just really out of my depth with this one. Can anyone provide insight? Thanks!",Any way to get out of working under a lien?
Chiropractic,"Hello, im a 28 female whos in great health and normal shape 5’2 130lbs. I’ve never been to a chiropractor mainly because I’m afraid I will love it so much that I’m going to waste a lot of money going weekly bc I’ve been told that it’s addicting. But im thinking about it to help prevent these migraines I’ve recently been having more and more often. Headaches are common for me- almost daily I have a mild headache. (I do have a desk job and stare at a computer but it never bothered me until this past year and I also put a blue light film on my computer and phone screen) 

Also my upper back and neck is sore from the way I sit or slouch. Not purposely. I try to correct it during the day and do stretch. Maybe something in my neck is pinched causing the headaches? 

Will getting adjusted have any positive bearing on my terrible migraines?",Can getting cracked help my migraines?

Chiropractic,"Hi all - I want to start on my neuro diplomate (soon) and while I am pretty sure of which program I will use I would like to hear from all of you about the differences (pro's, cons, etc.). I have been in practice over a little over 13 years and consider myself evidence-informed, but open minded. 

From what I have seen over the years, there are three main players (in no particular order):

Carrick Institute (DACNB), Functional Neurology Seminars (FIBFN) and Clinical Neurosciences Institute (DIBCN).

While Carrick appears to be very popular, someone I highly respect thinks Carrick teaches some ""questionable physiology"". I have heard good things about Dr. Kharrazian but don't have firsthand experience. I actually know people who have the DIBCN and they are docs to whom I would not hesitate to refer a friend or family member. 

I would appreciate hearing others impressions or experiences (or even what you have heard). 

Thanks.",Various neurology diplomates and their associated educational programs

https://www.reddit.com/r/Chiropractic/comments/usx5to/giving_notice_prior_to_leaving_my_current/

So I gave a 6 week notice to my employer when he got back from vacation and was met with disgust and noted that I ""lacked character"" etc. Afterwards I continued work as if there was nothing different, greeted and bid good evening to the boss and his wife each morning/evening. 

I was given the cold shoulder and wasn't spoken to unless I initiated the conversation (but this was expected and I didn't have much of a problem with it). As soon as I turned in my notice the relationship soured and I was bad mouthed to the CAs which would always tell me everything since they liked me and I treated them well. 

 Two weeks after my notice I asked if I could take two days off at the end of the week to have a vasectomy performed while I still had insurance. He responded with an ""are you (freaking) kidding me, I told (wife's name who is our office manager) you would do this (crap)"". I simply asked for time off to get this done and wanted to know if he was okay with it. After going through a tirade of telling his wife that I had the audacity to go have a second vasectomy (not true btw, I only had a consult last year after my second kid). He told me that evening that this would be my last day so he could focus on his own thing and because I was asking off work. I just found out today that they canceled my insurance before I could get my vasectomy done.

I never submitted my CEs or relicensing fees to be reimbursed even though they are covered in my contract. I'm also entitled severance pay upon termination of one month per my contract. This guy and his wife have always had a terrible attitude and never spoke well of any previous employees (or patients for that matter). I thought it might be different though because I never gave any problems, always showed up to work and did my job, even when I had minor procedures performed on the same day. Never took all of my PTO in a single year while I was employed with him.

Was it crappy to ask for a couple of days off to get a vasectomy during my final 6 weeks? maybe... I still had 10-12 days of PTO left that are part of my benefits package for working there. The timing of it was most convenient for me with the move coming up and working at the clinic every other Saturday morning.

Regardless, I figured at this point I'll wait for my final check to come in the mail and then I'll see if they included my severance check (which I know they won't). I'll then submit for reimbursement for my CEs and my severance pay.

What if they try and deny my severance pay and CEs/relicensure fees? Just seek out a labor law attorney?

Thanks for letting me vent to y'all, I'm glad to be out of there and moving to a new position and location. I probably wouldn't have mentioned any of this if I could've just kept my (and kids) insurance through the end of the month.",Follow up to leaving associate position.
Chiropractic,"Like do any Chiros just do neck only in this case? Sort of afraid for a chiro to press other muscles where I'm mostly sore now like my belly, chest, side, and maybe back. My Mom says she has to pay 60 for me for a quick neck adjustment or is that for everything? Got no idea. That sucks if its 60 no matter what.

Idk if chiro should be pressing other muscles that are sore or feel like they hurt. Maybe? Or no?",So I've been going to a Physical therapist and she rubs my muscles for 1 hour and we do stretching exercises.

Chiropractic,"I am not sure if this is the right sub to post this… but for the past year, my back has felt so tight and sore. The only relief I can get is from cracking it… and usually doing it myself isn’t successful so I lay on my stomach on the floor and ask my fiancé to put his foot on my back and kind of stomp on it with sudden jolt to crack it. It feels great, but usually need it again after couple of hours. I am not sure what to do, but I know this is probably not safe to continue…

Chiropractic,"When I was 19 I had tension in my neck and saw a chiropractor. He showed me that my C1 was out of alignment, had me lay sideways on a table with my ear in a slot, stood above me and pressed on the spot while the table made a sound as if it dropped.

I was instantly healed and for months fine until the tension came back and I saw him again. I was healed.

Unfortunately, I always had my visits very spread out and over the years the relief has been more brief. He is strange in a sense because he’s never pitched a treatment plan. He’s never diagnosed anything. I just go in he pops the C1 in place and that’s it.

I am really tired of this C1 continually going out and causing crazy tension. I did try seeing doctors, physical therapists, and even a PRI coach over the past 13 years. All that didn’t do anything he is still the only one that helps me and he still practices.


 I am thinking of going back to getting adjusted and just do it more frequently like once every 3 days and incorporate exercises like “chin tuck” along with working on correcting muscle disimbalances in my body. I finally realize I have always had bad posture and do hold my head forward and will work on correcting that as well.

I’m just curious your thoughts on this situation? I am nervous because I really want this to go away and I don’t have health insurance if things go downhill from trying this.",I’ve been seeing an upper cervical chiropractor for 13 years off and on…
