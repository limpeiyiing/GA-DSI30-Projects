Also, it looks as if Complete Anatomy has postponed their next project to measure a patient's ROM using the iPad's LiDAR ability.

Chiropractic,"So I have slight bad posture. Neck that tilts forward, uneven shoulders, and a slight trunk rotations. Doesn't really bother me but im hoping to fix it, since I got pretty good insurance that covers things like massage, PT, and chiropractic.    


I went to get examined... and the chiropractor took some xrays. These basically confirmed the issues I already knew about (so its not like they were bullshiting me there).  However after these xrays they tried to get me to pre-pay for 6 months worth of treatment (3 visits/week). Treatment being in-office adjustments and at home exercises. Even after insurance this ends up being a couple thousand of dollars out of pocket for me.

Chiropractic,"Sorry if this is not the place to post this! I know this sub is mostly for chiropractors and less for patients, but I'm hoping that someone here might have some answers. My question is basically the title. The chiropractor I've been seeing takes x rays at the beginning and middle of treatment. I've been going since early January because I was referred after a car accident. Researching online now I'm seeing a lot about how unhelpful and unnecessary x rays are for chiropractic care, and that it's often essentially a sales tactic with lots of false promises (this place insists on them). I feel like that is becoming even more clear now, because my x rays from last week show some major issues that weren't even there before. For example my pelvis has become misaligned and my neck at C2 has jumped to the right way out of alignment in the images. I've been experiencing more pain in those areas as well. When I mention it during an adjustment, I've been told that it is normal to feel pain elsewhere as they are realigning my neck and upper back. I did not go into this wanting to simply move the pain elsewhere. Is that actually a normal thing for chiropractic care? The chiropractor even said ""huh"" and ""that's weird"" about my xrays, and then immediately went into a confusing spiel about how we can't expect everything to be getting better because it's only been a short time and that there are some improvements so everything is fine. For reference it has been 4 months, most of which they had me going 3 times a week. The last few weeks I told them it was too often for my schedule and went down to two times a week. Should I be seeing better improvements at this point? I'm really starting to think I've been scammed, but would appreciate professional opinions on this one. Thanks in advance.",Midway x rays worse than before treatment

At the chiropractor I work for, he uses EMS as part of his treatment as well as ultrasounds. This is performed on patients by employees who aren’t certified or properly trained to do so.

Chiropractic,"One of my chiro's standard checks is where they get you to raise one leg at a time and tell you to hold it up while they push down to check how much force you can resist before they can push your leg down. Nine times out of ten my left leg is a lot 'weaker' so he slightly adjusts my left pelvis (a slight counterclockwise rotation, if you were standing to the left of me) which fixes the issue (both legs can then resist a similar amount of pressure. 

I'm not sure how technically accurate this is (I expect it is probably somewhat of a simplification) but he said the issue is essentially the nerve sending messages to the muscles in your leg is pinched/partially blocked by the pelvis and the slight rotation unblocks it. After this, the messages get through a lot clearer and the 'strength' in both legs is much more similar.

Q1 Is there a name for this type of test? 

Q2 Is the nerve in question the sciatic nerve? 

Q3 How accurate is the above description of what is happening.

Q4 Are there any stretches/similar I could do at home between chiro visits to unblock this?

Insurance has me going to a chiropractor for treatment on their dollar. I have been going (5 adjustments so far) to a chiropractor by my place that has good reviews. But he is doing stuff that I’ve never heard of and can’t really find info on. I talk with some friends and family and they all say to switch, but I’m unsure.


That he does is; has me lay face down, puts the little shoes on me, lifts and lowers my legs and such, flicks/wipes my lower back softly, lifts and lowers feet some more, flicks the back of my head, has me turn my head and such as he continues to flick and wipes parts of my body, uses that clicker pen thing sometimes.

He has a cracking bed thingy in the office, but have not used it’s at all. 

I leave feeling no difference at all, and recently my back pain has been getting worse, I told him, he did not response.

Chiropractic,"I'm absolutely sure this has been discussed a thousand times but I'm not really familiar with the chiropractic world. I'm one of those cases where ""I saw something online and now I have questions"". I was watching a documentary about faith healing and its debunking and one of the faith healer's favorite truck was to even out or ""grow"" a leg which was slightly shorter than the other. If course he did this by pouring the individual's legs in the position he wanted and showing them that they appeared to be different lengths.

I'm not casting aspersions here but it makes me question every time I have an adjustment done. I feel that if I were the one seeing my legs where I wanted them, they would be even but I'm expected to trust the chiropractor that he or she is being completely honest about it. It's not that I believe all chiropractors are charlatans but there's still a certain stigma that maybe you can help me overcome. I understand the explanation behind how and why the adjustment works to even out the pelvis but it seems impossible for me to distinguish between an actual need for adjustment and a chiropractor setting me up to come in on the regular.

Chiropractic,"I have been a chiropractor for well over 20 years now, have a degree in Business, marketing and specifically advertising.  I worked in the big corporate advertising world for a few years before becoming a chiro.

'Wouldn't you like to have a practice that is less stressful?' etc...) but then only offer you the 'order my plan and I will give you the secrets'. 

Here is the secret...

Ready? 

Consistency, Community, Compassion, Continually adapting.  

(Then you can sub structure for things like price point, reach, frequency, the four Ps of marketing, demographics and all that...)

Find your niche?  please... It is chiropractic... Use a niche as your focus for a short while only... YOUR chiropractic style.  Your ""perfect patient""?

I am having a debate with my friend who is currently in a chiropractic program. He always claims that chiropractic is vitalistic, and I do not really understand what he is talking about.

1. Stretchers or braces is it worth investing in such things do they actually help or at least in your experience has it? 
2. Pillows for sleeping I am a mixed sleeper (back and side) is there a pillow I can get that can also help me?
3. Is it possible to fix this now? Or am I screwed?

I am getting mixed messages and I really would like some help with getting this issue addressed. Any help is good help.

Chiropractic,,"I went to a chiropractor today because my lower back was hurting. While feeling on my back she asked if I held in my anger a lot, I do. How would she be able to figure that out just by feeling around on my body?"

Chiropractic," Today was my first time going to the chiropractor, the doctor let me know that I would need to pay $4000 for 4 months, and 2 sessions a week. He told me that my neck is not in the normal position and is streching the signals from my brain stem to my spinal cord so is affecting the nervious system or something, and that it would be severe if not treated on time.

I wonder if this price seems reasonable. Btw I live in New York.
