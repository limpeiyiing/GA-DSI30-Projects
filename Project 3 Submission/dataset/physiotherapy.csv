I graduated from physio at the start of this year. 

Since then I have been working in a private practice in Sydney.

I love the kind of patients I get to help in the private practice environment but have started to feel burnt out because of the demands from this kind of an environment. I have started to wonder if physio is something I want to do long-term too.

At the moment, I am considering going into aged care physio but am unsure if there's going to be a need for aged care physio's after the changes happen to ACFI in October later this year.

Just wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom, thanks!",Private Practice to Aged Care Physio - Sydney

4,physiotherapy,"Hello All,



Just want to state before we start I have absolutely no knowledge on physiotherapy, however I am asking this question in an attempt to be able to understand my friends situation more.


My friend has exhuast 2/3 of  their PCE exam attempts, I am confident in their skill &amp; knowledge, they scored 575 in their most recent attempt, they work extremely hard, this is not only their chosen career path but also their life's passion. 


Anyways, question is, what happens after 3 attempts?
 Can they go back to school and try again? 
Are there any exceptions? 
What options are out there for people who failed all 3 attempts? 

I just want to know what the plan is in the worst case scenario (failing 3 times )

5,physiotherapy,"I'm planning on applying to 3 physio schools in Ontario this fall, UofT, Western, and McMaster. I'm in a healthcare field (nutrition and dietetics) but didn't seriously consider PT until about a year ago, so I didnt get the psych prereqs for alot of other schools in Canada.

My subGPA is looking like it'll be around 3.9, which I'm pretty comfortable with. But I don't have much direct physio experience. I have experience coaching and doing nutrition counselling for martial arts, some social media stuff for private dietetics firms, and some experience working with the dietary staff at a LTC home (where I first got interested in rehab). I also have some experience developing workshop/seminars about HIV/AIDS, concussion identification for softball players, and posture tips to avoid MSK disorders when working from home.

7,physiotherapy," 

Do I have bicep tendonitis or Brachialis Tendinopathy ?

Sorry, not sure where to put this but I really need help:

Hi, I really need help. I have had pain under my bicep for ages now. It has been 6-7 Months. The pain has gotten better but the pain is still present but progress has officially stopped . I have stopped weight training for 6-7 months now and its causing me distress and depression (a bit over the top I know).

I have been to my local GP and they have stated it is muscle over use. I was prescribed a few stretches to do to alleviate the pain but it still has not gone (again, doing this for 6-7 months) I have been using hot water bottles on it 2-3x a day. Its getting ridiculous. I feel as though the GP is just saying its muscle overuse but they may not understand that it could be something deeper. To Note: the physotherapist states it is also muscle overuse.

I just do not want to have this for another 7 months. I do not believe it is bicep tendonitis as, correct me if i am wrong, but I do not have pain shooting from my shoulders or elbow. It only appears to be under my bicep. Looking Online, I have come across Brachialis Tendinopathy which seems to be what I am feeling? Please can someone help I am stressed and wake up disheartened everyday as although, it may not be that deep, the only thing I enjoy is the Gym. Its been a sad 7 months. To note: I am not a rock climber nor do any other sports but go to the gym. I also was working retail at the time.

I have enclosed a few pictures to show where the pain is.. Dont judge the smallness of my arms it has been 6-7 months.

Please let me know if you need any questions or more pictures.

17,physiotherapy,"I'm Canadian and I've been injured. I completely believe that with *a lot* of physiotherapy, that's more akin to what a professional athlete would be provided, I could be rehabilitated. Maybe not fully, but at least to the point of being able to take on a labour intensive job if need be. The problem is that there's huge cost that goes with that amount of rehabilitation when one half an hour session, that's more like 20 minutes, costs $60 CAD. The model of physio in Canada seems to be centred around workers compensation insurance to get a patient out as fast as possible without full fledge rehabilitation. 

I've been trying to explore the idea of going to somewhere like Thailand, South America, China, or India to see if I can get the full standard of care instead of an expensive twenty minute session that might result in a few physio exercises with a band, some talk, and ultrasound.

20,physiotherapy,"In short, should physios need to consider the importance of nutrition when treating musculoskeletal issues in private practice, in particular when increasing strength?

My supervisor and I discussed this and we thought of the obvious example of stress fractures in dancers and marathon runners. It's well accepted that calcium intake must be screened in these people, especially since restrictive diets are common amongst them.

What about muscular weakness however? Personal trainers and exercise physiologists rightfully stress the basic need for increased (somewhat) protein intake to build significant amounts of muscle over long periods and an energy surplus is typically assumed.

Is there a point where we need to consider this in private practice? My supervisor and I had these basic points:

**Reasons in favour:**

* In older populations, addition of protein supplements (usually whey) has been shown to improve muscle gained/preserved relative to resistance training alone
* In athletic populations, the standard for strength is very high and energy needs are high. There *may* be cases wherein poor nutrition/recovery undoes or limits the effectiveness of our resistance training rehab.

**Reasons against:**

* Only a small proportion of patient problems are *purely* strength-related
* In more sedentary populations, the strength gains needed to make significant progress will be mostly or almost entirely due to *neurological* changes, not hypertrophy and thus, less dependent on energy balance and protein intake
* Nutrition is beyond our scope of practice. Referral to a dietician is easy in a hospital but may be less practical in private practice.
* Most studies looking at resistance training for common musc issues (knee/hip OA, tendinopathy) do not control for diet yet yield good results.

My general conclusion thus far is that it worth investigating diet in high-level athletes or those requiring restrictive diets - however these people likely already have nutritional oversight.

25,physiotherapy,"Context: I’m in my first year out of uni as a private practice musculoskeletal physio in Australia. I’ve lived out of home since I was 18, never really had much or been able to save up. 

I started my first job several months ago. The clinic seemed amazing, the interview went well with my now boss who seemed much like the physio I would want to develop into.

The contract I am on is set up with this incredibly low day rate and then I am paid per patient. Kind of like a contractor but I was asked to work full time. I asked around and got mixed responses about this being normal. Some others said it was unfair, even predatory, for a new grad to be expected to be paid per patient. 

I ended up accepting it because the opportunity seemed worth it and my boss stated that the patient numbers would steadily increase and I would be well supported after a few months. 

Once I started working there were some preparatory strategies, but very little structured professional development. Basically just shadowing. This was for about a week and a bit then for the most part I was asked to do every odd job. Random admin, social media work, website design, marketing, doctor letters. My patient numbers increased but slowly and I was consistently told to improve my rebooking strategies. 

This went on for nearly three months, my time completely filled with nonphysio tasks. Occasional chats with my boss, mostly about improving rebooking. I worked hard to show my worth. 

It reached the end of probation and I asked my boss to increase my pay rate (the other physios mentioned they were getting more than double, and asked I be raised to that). Boss declined and offered me a different rate, that seemed better. I accepted, but realised it actually paid worse so I asked the next day to return to the previous rate. I told my boss I would have to cut my hours, would no longer complete the random assortment of tasks unless compensated to do so and that I would look for more supplementary work until the patient load supported me better. 

Boss agreed to this but then paid me the worse rate which I had to bring up at work. If your not keeping count this is the fourth chat about pay rates. The boss also docked the bonus I was normally paid since then. 

Finally, last week I did a twenty minute Google to find out if the pay rate was legal. Turns out I was paid at less than 60% of MINIMUM wage for nearly 6 months (including ‘bonuses’) and the contract was completely illegal. Also, Employees are not expected to take on financial risks, that’s the employers role. I called a government agency to check and they confirmed it and told me to make a written request for pay owed within 7 days to my boss. If my boss didn’t comply I would escalate it to the government agency where the penalties were $10,000 to 60,000 for just one of the offences. 

I tried to calmly raised the issues with my boss using the guidelines from the government agency. They felt they had supported me fairly and that based on everything so far I was not cut out for private practice and should work in government. I told my boss I strongly disagreed. They said they needed to think about my request and would make some calls. 

I didn’t mention the penalties or that I would be making a written request for the pay out of courtesy. 

I honestly don’t want to have to escalate it or report them to any physio organisations. They employs a great team of physios, have a lovely family and the clinic helps a lot of people. 

Am I overreacting? Is this pay structure common? 

I really don’t know what to do. Open to any and all suggestions. 

TLDR: new grad physio paid 60% of minimum wage, unable to negotiate, boss reduced pay repeatedly and now I’m escalating it but I’m not sure whats best to do.",Being paid well below minimum wage. Is this normal?? I’m having disputes with my boss. I don’t know what to do.

Upcoming Ontario graduate here and I've gotten a number of offers and am debating between two to start right now, and I was hoping for some input :)

1) private practice: 
- 4 minute drive from home 
- 4 day workweek (flexible hours, 4 9s probably)
- Smaller practice with few MVA and WSIB
-  50% fee split *employee* status, so CPP/taxes/EI/4% vacation will be paid
- 12-16 patients per day with a wait list into September, so relatively steady and busy 
- 37.50 to start for 3 months if I don't want a fee split immediately 
- 1000$ education fund 
- health spending account (I think $1000)
- 2 weeks vacation for year 1, up to 3 in year 2, and 4 weeks after 5 years
- 4 additional unpaid professional development days 
- I don't know if there's a ton of opportunity for formal mentorship or anything since it's a very small practice/team 
- own laptop to chart and basically my own treatment room since there aren't a bunch of clinicians bouncing around 

2) private practice but MOH funded clinic 
- 45 minute commute 
- did a placement there so I'm familiar with it 
- contracted employee 
- $44 per hour 
- $1500 education fund 
- $1500 health spending account 
- 4 day workweek, flexible with which days off I want
- unlimited unpaid vacation (CPP/EI/taxes/4% vacation not paid)
- connections to family health team in same building which could allow for development of new programs and such (which I would like to do) 
- I don't know if there is a formal mentorship program 
- occasionally I noticed on placement that treatment rooms would sometimes be unavailable because there's lots of clinicians, and they chart on paper, and there aren't formal ergonomic desks and chairs to do charting 
- wouldn't have my own computer or laptop to do work

It's my first job and really I'd like to get into some type of research and program development down the way, maybe transition to acute care at some point, so I believe that I won't be staying in private practice for more than 5-6 years (unless something really changes). My life dream is *not* to own a clinic so I'm not looking for substantial leadership and growth to get to partnership or anything.

Any thoughts? Would you commute for the second offer? Any opinions on fee splits?

The second offer has much more flexibility for vacation and life, but the first one is much closer to home and lets me be an employee and get those government perks.

39,physiotherapy,"I have been in physiotherapy for two months now. I started after a car accident. I had all over back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, pain at the base of my head, and they are treating me for headaches and jaw pain too.

For headaches and jaw pain they are just doing laser.

For my lower back the do tens and usually the laser and have done ultrasound maybe twice.

For my shoulders they use the tens machine and ultrasound.

My neck they've really done next to nothing for...same wuth the base of my head. But they started booking me for massage which helps my neck slightly. I have only had one massage appointment, but the PT does some massage each session  anyway.

Now my issue is, I was feeling over all better until the Tueday before last. When I rolled over in my sleep, not sure what happened or why, but my shoulder got hurt. I had PT that day and brought it up because my shoulder was hurting more than it did directly after the accident. So they decided to focus the tens on my one shoulder rather than both which is fine. She also said that it was my neck, and that she was going to stretch out my neck. She did a little massage on the area, which she hadn't been doing before, and kind of pulled up on it a bit while I was laying on  my back. Then she had me sit in a chair so she could ""stretch out my neck."" She grabbed my head at my jaw and pulled on it pretty hard. Then asked me to turn my head to one side and did it again, then the other side and did it again. This hurt, and did not feel good. It gave me zero release.

I have only seen anything like it, in videos of chiropractors when they are adjusting people, and you hear cracks. There were  no cracking sounds when  she did it, but it felt like she was just mimicking something she saw a chiropractor do, and like she shouldn't have been doing it. The office has a sign up that they are looking for a new chiropractor and don't currently have one... maybe that's why.

I was in WAY more pain when I left that day then when I got there. I have also been in pain non stop since. My neck is hurting really bad constantly, and my shoulder is hurting like crazy. It takes hours to fall asleep because sleeping on the side of my painful shoulder is unbearable....sleeping on the other side still causes that shoulder to hurt, and it's hard and still painful to sleep on my back. Sleeping on my back also hurts my neck, but it's the best for my shoulder, although still extreamly painful. My neck and shoulder are currently a hundred percent worse than just after the accident and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm an avid cricket and football player although recently i am experiencing this one really weird and painful injury that comes and goes.  
Warning: it's hard to describe hence not finding any solutions in google  
Essentially, when I bowl in cricket im putting a lot of stress onto my front foot (left foot) when i land, very frequently after a ball it feels as though something solid like a metal rod is running from my little toe to just before my ankle (obviously there is nothing there and must be a muscle doing something), it is extremely painful and the weirdest part is that i can completely get rid of it by taking off my shoe and cracking/bending the knuckle on my little toe. Although it's great that i can fix it, it's difficult to do this in the middle of a match and sometimes the crack just wont happen so i have to run around uncomfortably for a while until it does.

Wouldn't be suprised if some of the smaller sites share a single AHP rather than having a 4-days weekly dedicated site PT/OT. 

I've got mixed feels on this as can still see a 4x weekly physio for most sites adding a lot of value if allowed to do *real* physio work, but can also see a lot of aged care physios potentially struggling with this unless they've had some private/community experience, and a lot of facility managers concentrating on their financial bottom lines/making calls based on ACFI-based AHP work they've seen for years. 

I'm anticipating lots of aged care physios to start bailing ship over Aug-Sep; perhaps earlier if they're smart/before all the NDIS spots fill up (I think it'd be a tough for aged care physios to transition into private practice).

I fell and dislocated my shoulder, got it back into place but it keeps popping out

I don't really have a fitness question, but I see a lot of dislocated shoulder questions here so I hope my post will be allowed and somebody will be able to give me an advice.

So, today while playing soccer, I fell on my outstretched arm and dislocated my left shoulder. I got up, couldn't move my arm, felt some pain when trying to move it. That was around 8:30 pm.

I kneeled down in front of a bench, slowly lifted my left arm, grabbed the far end of the bench and leaned back slowly. It easily popped back in. I put two ice cold water bottles on it for a few minutes. I then changed my sneakers completely normal with both hands, leaning down, tied them up... a few minutes after that my shoulder popped back out while I turned my head and looked over that shoulder. Popped it back in the same way. A few minutes later, I scratched my right shoulder with my left hand and my left shoulder popped back out. I then completely limited my movement and had no mishaps until an hour and a half ago (2.5 hours after the fall). Went to take a shower, tried keeping my left arm perfectly still when I took my tshirt off, and I alouched a bit and it popped back out. So 3 times after the inital fall, in space of 2-ish hours.

Went to the ER in my town, bit they just told me they cannot do anything, can't tell me anything, I need to go to the next city to have a x-ray... I have no one to take me until the morning so here I am. Half past midnight, sleepy as hell, but don't have the courage to lie down.

So my main question is - is it at all normal for a shoulder to keep popping out until the area cools off a bit? Being able to tie my shoes after the fall has me thinking I should be fine, but constant popping afterwards scares me a bit.

I usually slouch quite a lot, so keeping upright is a bit hard for a long time, I get tired and my shoulders then start dropping. Have no idea what to do. It doesn't hurt right now (unless it pops out), so I'm kinda waiting for pain to come in, hoping that would mean it started cooling off and that I'll have more stability in the shoulder.

Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.","Dislocated shoulder keeps popping out after trauma - seeking NO advice, just information"

I cleared lumbar spine as you do, and competed full neuro ax : dermatomal light touch indicated more sensitive in the affected side mostly in their outer thigh but when dabbing towards medially sensations were normal. Sharp touch was the same. No loss of myotomes just weakness in affected side and reflex NAD babinski NAD.

tl;dr: What are the qualifications/requirements to work as a physio in your country or state?

Since PT in Germany is still a 3 year training at a private or state school working abroad due to academisation in most countries has turned into a difficult process. Many universities offer bachelors degrees which can be done in one year after you finish PT school to be ""internationally qualified"" yet from what I've heard, colleagues who've absolved this ridiculed themselves over how easy it was. I've began to wonder if this really is enough to be qualified as a PT in your countries, where from what I've heard on here the training/study is really intense. Don't get me wrong, PT school in Germany is still not easy and compared to other schoolings should definitely be a degree. Maybe there are some German physios here who can compare...

143,physiotherapy,"I'm not looking for medical advice, but wanted to get a sense from this community if the doctor was professional or not.

Due to various reasons, I developed pain in 3 different areas that together make it very painful for me to walk for more than 10 mins. I went from easily walking 15k steps per day, to barely making it through 7k. I asked for referrals, but couldnt get to the bottom of the issue with 2 different physiotherapist. My family doctor ended up referring me to a Sports Medicine Doctor. 

I shared my symptoms and issues with the doctor, and told her all the stuff you can read below, and that I think that there is some underlying issue that the physiotherapists are not identifying. I want to get to the root cause of all these issues with my back and legs and develop a preventative routine/approach.

She told me I have too many issues, and western medicine only focuses on one issue at a time. She also said that I overwhelmed her and probably overwhelmed the other physiotherapists and that's why they can't help me. She recommended rehab pilates and other private services that are not covered by the public insurance system. She also suggested to see an osteopath, and said I have some kind of adjustment issue (when leaning back, I lean a bit more to one side). I'm not sure why she wouldn't work with me on a plan..

My questions are:

Is it accurate to say that ""western medicine can't help"" me? My impression is that I go to a doctor, describe my symptoms, and then the professional identifies a common thread or concurrent issues, and we decide on what to address first. It never happened to me that a doctor told me they can't help me because I have ""too many issues"". It ended up being ""too many issues"" because there's a huge backlog in services, and by the time I was able to get an appointment to get a referral or assessment, other issues came up. So by the time I got to her, there were 3 issues instead of 1.

Also, is it true that physiotherapists can only focus on one thing at a time? What if another (related) issue arises from the therapy, or the physiotherapist didn't identify the problem correctly, so the exercises are not effective/create new problems? What if there's a related issue that shows up during the treatment for another issue?

Lastly, any advice how I can organize my description/ approach to be the most effective? I just need someone to figure out why things hurt and how to fix those issues. I need to start exercising to treat other issues I have (the pandemic really messed up my health), and I can't really move forward because everyone just dismisses me.


********

Background for context:

In total, I've seen 5 different physiotherapists over the past 10-12 years, in different provinces, with varying degrees of success, but 4/5 times, I was very satisfied with the service, treatment, and outcome.

In the past 1.5 years, I developed plantar fasciatiis, but I didn't realize it was an issue for the first 4 months. It overlapped with the pandemic + lots of changes in my life, so it took me about 6-8 months to realize there is a problem and need to take care of it. Around the same time, I started feeling some pain in my calf, but I thought it was a random ache (I have a lot of those that end up being nothing). I saw a physiotherapist for a while for the plantar fasciiatis, and the treatment was very helpful but stopped going because of unrelated issues (I actually liked her). I mentioned the pain in my calf, but she just shrugged it off.. so I figured it's one of my random aches.

Other than that, I have an old back injury (unknown source, it just started hurting one day after a hard week at work 12 years ago) that comes back every once in a while. Usually, I would go to a physiotherapist (referral from my family doctor), they would prescribe exercises, and I would be back in shape after a couple of months. Not all the physiotherapists were great, but their methods were fairly consistent (other than the last one I saw).

About 6 months ago, I had a weird COVID-like onset of symptoms that included severe back and leg pain, fever, etc. It ended up being a viral throat infection. Since then, I'm having a flair up of my back pain (sciatica). I went to a different physiotherapist (different than the one who treated plantar fasciatiis). I didn't like that physiotherapist's approach and she was giving unprofessional advice, and stopped seeing her. I also mentioned the calf pain and she also shrugged it off. That's how I ended up with a referral to the sport medicine doctor, who was also unhelpful.","[Ontario, Canada] A Sports Medicine Doctor told me I have too many problems and western medicine can't help me. does that make sense?"

152,physiotherapy,"I'll preface this with the fact that I am from Australia, and that I am not looking for medical advice. 

I have had some upper back problems for around 3 to 4 years now, and am losing all hope of ever returning to normal.

For some backstory, my injury came seemingly out of nowhere. I hadn't been working for maybe 6 months, and was doing no hard physical activity at the time. I woke up in the morning, and bam, it was there. Obviously I slept on it wrong. 

In the last 3-4 years, I have been to so many different physio's, also sport therapists, myotherapy and just about any other type of therapy I could think of. Mainly physio's though, as I am of the understanding that physio is evidence and science based.

It seems every physio I go to, they do the exact same thing which doesn't seem to be doing anything. They have all tried to associate my injury to my current job, which I inform them that I wasn't doing before the injury, and I wasn't doing when the injury occurred. It always starts with ""ok, now cross your arms on your chest and put your hands on your shoulders. and now roll forward. ok, now bend back. Now, hands on shoulders and elbows out, and bend to the side. Now the other side."" These exersizes (or examinations) rarely engage or stretch the muscles that I feel that have been cramped up for the last 3-4 years (if they do, it's only a tiny bit). ""now how does that feel?"" to which I usually reply ""yeah, not too bad"" Or ""yeah I can feel it a bit in that sore spot I told you about""

They will then get me on the bed thing on my stomach, do some massage (sorry I don't know the proper term) or pressing around my spine to loosen up the muscles around my spine, then give me some exercizes to do at home. 

Always after the physical manipulation on the bed thing, they run me through the same stretching examination as at the start and say ""oh the movement is so much better!"" in my head I'm thinking 'bullshit, it's exactly the same and my back is still sore'.

They then rebook me for a week, explain that we will do weekly sessions until I see improvement at which time we will start to do fortnightly or monthly maintenance appointments. 

I then do the exersizes, come back weekly until THEY decide I have improved and we can start to do fortnightly or monthly sessions. Meanwhile, my back is still exactly the same, and they have not even touched the muscles that are causing me so much grief. 

Why do they seemingly refuse to touch the muscles that are causing me pain? I am absolutely dying for someone to just get their thumbs or elbow into the offending muscles. When I do it myself with a squash ball, it actually does help, but I feel like someone that has studied human anatomy should be able to do a better job than a rubber ball. Are these physio's just rubbish?

Anyway, this turned into a long post, and I'm sorry for any physio's in here that might think ""oh, he's one of *those* clients"". I'm not sure, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I just don't know why they all do the exact same thing, and call me fixed when nothing changes. To me it seems like it should be simple, just get in there and loosen up the part that hurts, but I'm not a physio so I could only assume I'm wrong. Also I'm sorry if this comes off as a rant, but I'm at my whits end because of this pain, and I feel like I don't even know what to do any more.",Am I just going to rubbish Physio's?

Do i find a health care related job first and then contact the uni ? given that I don't have any health care related qualification, should  I look for NHS band 2 job and once i got one , i can contact the uni ? is health care assistant the job i should look for? do i work for like 18 months and then can move up a band to be senior health care worker and later got a job which is more closely related to physiotherapy?

I was lucky to get a part-time job immediately with 2 home visits. The things is the patient (64 yr) that I'm seeing is a stroke case (6month old) that is unlike what I've ever seen. Her both side is paralysed with stiffness everywhere. She can only move her eyes, lips and head &amp; can't talk (due to tracheostomy). She used to cry when I tried to do passive movement (but it's improved now). Now she only cries when I try to do elbow and knee flexion and also stretching (if done mildly she'll try to bear it). Passive movement and stretching alone takes me 1.5 hrs to do and I'm only paid for 1 hr but I take my time since I've developed a bit of attachment towards her. And I'm not seeing much improvement on her. I really want to make her walk again. What more interventions should I try on her? Am I missing something? 

She does try to move her left side ankle and hands but that's it. There's no improvement.. I'm scared that the therapy that I'm doing is causing more stiffness since she cries and tightens her body. Please help me out...",Need some guidance

189,physiotherapy,"Hi guys!   I haven’t been on this subreddit for a while which I am very proud of as it did become quite addictive to keep asking for reassurance- but I am well and truly stuck on what to do next.   For context, 7-8 months ago, I damaged my hamstrings. Whenever I would cross my leg and then extend my leg, it would make a popping sound and it got progressively worse to the point I couldn’t crouch without it popping and not being able to walk for a few days. The worst experience was when it popped, could not put my weight on the leg and was unable to fully extend my leg for up to 48 hours.   I’ve been to my physio on three occasions in which they told me I’ve just got really tight hamstrings which has caused tendinitis. I was sent home with knee exercises which I’ve been doing for the last 8 months.   My leg feels so much stronger and I am able to sit cross legged but won’t sit in the position for too long due to, you guessed it ✨anxiety✨.   The problem is this has caused such a mental block, I just refuse to sit on the ground, to crouch or to move my leg in a position I feel it would cause that feeling again. So I’ve now just stopped living and doing the things I loved to do. I use to love doing yoga - no longer do it, I use to love sitting on the floor to play with my younger family members, I can’t even enjoy sunbathing on a beach towel purely down to just being so anxious.

190,physiotherapy,"tl;dr - I heard from a few people that PTs start off at a low wage, around 50k, and it can take years and years before even reaching 75k salary. Is this true? How fast does it take to build a name and get more clients?

This is my first time posting here so not too sure what to expect, but I am going into my fourth year of Health Sciences in Ontario, Canada. I have been thinking about pursuing physiotherapy for a while now and finished all the prerequisites for most schools across Canada, and my GPA for the last 2 years is around 8.8/10 (\~3.86/4). One of my coworkers at my current job (not physio-related) told me his brother is struggling to make good money as a PT and it just made me want to ask about salary. I know PTs usually start off with a lower salary and build up over time, but he told me that his brother has been working for over 3 years and still wasn't making over $60,000 CAD. I talked to his brother too and he said that it can take years to build up a name and for people to request appointments with you so that you have more clients and therefore make more money. It kind of bummed me out because my brother is a nurse making around 80k which requires less school, and since I work at a pharmacy, I know a lot about their career path and it takes around the same amount of school (maybe a year or two more) but multiple pharmacists have told me that you start at around 90k. 

I know money is not everything but I plan to get married soon and if you are from Canada you know renting and house prices are just insane now, so I just want to know if this is really true. One of the pharmacists told me that he knows someone who stopped working in PT clinics and just got a government job because it was paying more. I truly do want to work in a clinic and provide great service to people in need, but I don't want to do a Masters and end up not making enough to move out, let alone take care of a wife and kids.

192,physiotherapy,"Hi! I hope this is an ok question to ask. Where I live, you need a doctor's precription for physio appointments to be covered. I'm feeling more and more doubtful about the doctor's recs (he's a sports doctor who says he's very familiar with my issue, but his recomendations go against a bunch of more recent recommendations I've read in reputable publications - to give an idea, he wanted me in a brace ""24/7"" for 6 weeks with an ankle sprain (grade 2 tear) and doesn't want me to do any proprioception, balance or strengthening excercises ""until it's all healed up"", and he only ok'd back and forth range of motion exercises a full month into the injury, no circles or any lateral movement, even though there's no pain.)

He wants me to wait even longer to get a prescription to start physio, but I'm not sure how comfortable I feel about his recomendations, plus he's expensive and at this point it'd be cheaper to pay for a couple physio sessions out of pocket than pay for yet another 5 minute consultations where he tells me to wait and not do anything. But I'm not sure if a physio would be ok with me going against a doctor's recomendations. Also, I think this doctor is like this because he's not that young - would it be a good idea to look for a more recently graduated physio?

I'm nearing a 2 year prolonged leave of absence, following the development of a quite debilitating social/generalized anxiety/panic disorder with associated agoraphobia. 

Without providing too much detail, the condition is massively aggravated by being on clinical placement. Primarily due to the unfamiliarity of the location, new hospital etc. This all compounds and makes it difficult for me to perform at an acceptable level. 

I have thus far, completed 500 clinical hours with a remaining 15 weeks to do. I've never actually failed any subject/placement, but have always struggled practically.

My most recent placement experience was catastrophic and I was forced to take leave by faculty after a week, which pushed me into a bad avoidance cycle. So in my mind that was a big failure.

I've improved a reasonable amount in terms of managing anxiety symptoms during my time off. I've been working extremely dead end jobs, with no real way out. Mentally, I have quit my physio degree but there is a small glimmer of inspira

In the past, I've attempted and failed to obtain reasonable accommodations specifically around placement location (closer to home) and setting. I feel a degree of relative control around these factors would enable me to finish my degree.

Firstly, I have searched for an answer to my queries here and have not found a full set of answers. I am from the UK, but currently in Malaysia, and I'd like to specifically ask my questions to any UK practitioners, simply because I trust the NHS and the evidence-based medicine they practise (I am less interested in complementary or alternative medicine (I am 99% sure that DN is alternative medicine, but not even sure!?)). 

I am from the UK and living in Malaysia because I am a teacher in an international school. I have an injury in my calf muscle and am seeing a physiotherapist for the first time. As far as I can tell they are practising Western Medicine. I am a Biology teacher and everything being explained regarding muscle knots and an injury through overuse/ chronic lack of enough Oxygen makes sense from my A-level level of knowledge. 

He's done some great deep tissue massage that was really satisfyingly painful and I felt improvement after the first session. He also gave stretches etc. In the second session (Tuesday just gone) he did dry needling. It was very painful and the needles were very deep in my muscles and the whole sensation and experience made me feel physically sick. I struggled to walk after and am still limping. He explained to me that the needles break down trigger points and said that this is practised in Western countries. 

My question is: would you as a UK based physiotherapist provide this treatment? I know the evidence is scant but I'd really appreciate the insight into what is happening in the UK. As said, it's the first time I've seen a physiotherapist. Is this normal treatment in the UK? Is it worth the nauseating pain?

Just wondering what are the ""best"" masters courses currently? 

Best meaning:
-Shorter course
-Cheap
-Easy to apply to
-Good reputation (course or university)

I currently have a BSc in Sports Rehab and Athletic Therapy that I gained in Ireland but all the Irish masters are ridiculously expensive. 

If there is anyone who could provide input and maybe even some previous experience of masters courses I'd love to hear it!

228,physiotherapy,"Hi all! I’ll get straight to the point. I am a high school student currently preparing her high school baccalaureate exams in France (but I’m studying in an English school). For the past two years or so I had been vaguely interested in Physiotherapy and decided that I would apply to bachelor programs in physiotherapy. Now being an English speaker and having an international background I liked the idea of getting my degree in the Netherlands, because it is affordable, offers education in English but also closer to my home country. So I applied and got accepted into each of the universities proposing a physiotherapy bachelor. 

However, this year I decided to do much more research on physiotherapy as a profession and found that I as having really bad cold feet about doing this degree. This is mainly because the degree program that I applied to is:
1) a vocational degree so it is very specialized and I am afraid that it has little scope of change should I not like it 
2) taught from a very small university, and I can’t even practice in the Netherlands with this degree because I don’t speak Dutch
3) I am terribly afraid of committing 4 years of my life to a degree that is so specific right out of highschool.

What I do like however is the whole aspect of travelling and meeting new people but I also want to have a degree that I’m fully comfortable with. 

So my other option is to do the medical exams of France in French (which is okay because it is my mother tongue )
This means doing a preparatory class for one year after I graduate high-school in order to pass the medschool exam for France and potentially study medicine for a minimum of nine years. 
This is good because it’s giving me a chance to try for other health professions and maybe test my aptitude for medicine (who knows maybe I’ll actually like it) 
It’s more broad than the focused professional training of physiotherapy for example. 
However this choice is also super uncertain, as everything depends on one’s ranking on the competitive exams and if your ranking isn’t good enough, you do not qualify for medschool (so now you’re back to square one) 
So I now find myself in an awful dilemma: which study choice is better for me? 
I really need some form of advice to help me out, my mind is saturating at this point.. thank you so much",Choosing to study physiotherapy or medicine?

240,physiotherapy,"I was wondering if anyone has any advice or insight. 

I currently have a fallen arch on my left foot. Tore meniscus (mid-tear) a year and a half ago. Left glute activation (firing) requires a lot of effort. When I do hip exercises, left hip is very stiff. I have to currently manually flex my left glute and leg, to get my left foot to not arch. I noticed now and throughout past 3-5 years, my left foot grip is not that strong, and used to shift a little more to the left. I want to return to play soccer and run properly with confidence. 

Context - I had a meniscus mid tear about a year and a half ago. I used to play soccer few times a month. Regular men's pick up leagues. For the past 3-5 years I'd say I'd always have pain when playing soccer, but somehow goes away after playing for like 15 minutes (but I think this was because I had flat feet then, I did not realize I had flat feet then).  Also, planning to join a league in 3 weeks, competitive (once a week games), but not super competitive, as to what I am used to.

Due to the tear, I couldn't lift my left leg much when running, so I rested it and did not do alot of physical activity, worked out though on and off. I started going to drop in soccer with some friends, recreational games. 

I played a few men league games, friend called me up. I felt fine during the games, most probably due to deep stretching for lower body (hips, calves, etc). Also, using my knee brace, where I have straps that lock my knee in.

Also, I try flex my arch as much as possible, and notice I get way more sore now when walking and some pain. I feel l need some sort of custom soles. I also walk in sandals now at home, they provide me so much relief.

I will visit some professionals soon for further advice, it's that I do not have coverage at the moment as I contracting and actively looking for private insurance in Toronto, Canada.

Also, I see that the Canadian GPA scale is different in terms of percentages. I had a few questions;

1. When PT schools calculate GPA do they use their own scales with my percentages? or do they use my letter grades? If they use my letter grades do they consider +/- or only what is written on my transcript? 
2. Do PT schools consider the fact that my school does not do +/-?
3. Are percentage grades included in final transcripts or is it only letter grades?
4. I know not many PT schools in Canada accept international students however for Mcmaster and UBC the case is different. Does anyone know the % of international students accepted into their PT programs?

PFJ syndrome is by far the most frustrating thing to treat in my opinion, largely because it's so complex, the obvious treatments don't always work and those that *do* work don't entirely make sense.

Case in point, glute max strengthening; why does it work? I understand that for things like sit-to-stands or climbing stairs, having stronger hip extension lessens the requirement for active knee extension = less quads activity = less PFJ pressure.

However most people with PFJ pain (depending on the mechanism) have pain simply with walking. EMG studies and a bit of common sense shows that the glute max isn't involved in walking unless you take large, aggressive strides - yet the treatment *usually* works.

In my collected knowledge after minor incidents or surgeries patients are evaluated and released home to rehabilitate on their own, mainly given a verbal ir written advice on what to do further. Ideally, appointments after several weeks are scheduled to track healing progress, however, not in every case.

That is why I am interested finding out whether physiotherapy specialist see the need for further supervision of their patients. Maybe it is an over exaggeration of problem that do not exist?

284,physiotherapy,"As a PT student (Australia), I am curious about many different things ranging from classic Physiotherapy pain science and rehabilitation to neuroscience, psychology and general health. Every day I talk to people asking what they think a private PT does, and the answer/expectations are always very similar: assessment, diagnosis, treatment, exercises, see you one week later, repeat.

As a PT student, I think I can help people more than just recovering from pain. What's stopping PT's from looking at someone's health as a whole? (I know many do, but the community generally \[N=25\] has a strict idea of our role, and venturing outside of this appears taboo). We did this heaps on clinical hospital placements, always checking blood pressure, reading charts and learning about how different medications might affect someone's ability to mobilise.

What is the reason that people can't come in and see PT's for a general health check up or basic health assessment? i.e. blood pressure check, whole body strength testing, cardiovascular fitness testing, assessing markers for longevity (whatever that means, not sure yet), quick mental health check in, etc. It seems that many people see personal trainers for this type of ""non-GP"" information. Why can't that be us? Or is it us? Idk!

Why can't people see PT's as the gateway to improved health overall, where patients come in asking ""how can I challenge my self-limiting beliefs?"", ""How can I begin developing good habits?"", ""How can I invest in my own health?"", ""what's the best way for me to begin exercising?""

I understand that some of this might just be a dream and seem outside of a PT's scope, but I can't help but think PT's could facilitate gen-pop's entry to overall health and exercise. And also not only taking people **in pain** to performance, but people **without** **pain** into performance/health.

Would love some opinions, as of course I am not yet in the industry, so there could be many problems here.

290,physiotherapy,"Hi, I'm starting my new job as physiotherapy assistant this month, and I'll be working in a hospital. The few people I've met so far have been really kind, and at first i was super excited but now I'm so scared 

I've only had 1 job before - working with disabled young people as a summer job - I'm 22, just finished uni (doing psychology, so not even medical related), I feel underqualified, like I'm going to mess everything up, and I shouldn't be working in a hospital, like I'm not smart enough. I'm worried I won't be able to handle the responsibilities or something! I'm going to get training for a bit before starting the job properly but I'm just really nervous. I keep imagining messing up and everyone being frustrated with me or getting mad at me, or getting myself fired:/ 

I have dyslexia which affects my ability to retain information properly and effects my memory and processing speed, and I always got told off for ""not listening"" at school, even though I was, I just had a hard time processing it and remembering instructions, especially if I couldn't write it down to reference it - what if this happens at the job? I told them about this and they were really understanding, I know I'm probably overreacting and catastrophising but it's just because I don't want to mess it up, especially for the patients 

Sorry for rambling, idk anyone else who works in hospitals or in this kind of job who I can ask for advice

294,physiotherapy,"So I was neglected and ignored as a child, hence why these things have only just been picked up.

So a couple of years ago, I saw a physiotherapist for the first time for a dry needling procedure to release painful trigger points all over my back (I have GAD). It worked very well. 

However, as soon as I walked in the room, the PT told me “you have low muscle tone”. I thought they meant I didn’t have much muscle (true), but they explained that they meant my muscles were “loose”, i.e. had lower resting tension than usual. I’ve always been horrible at sport, lean on everything, slump, lean while sitting, etc. 

They said it was still within the “normal” range, albeit right at the lower end, and that in my case it’s probably just genetic (my father and all of my siblings have it too).

I was talking before I was walking as a child (spoke early, didn’t walk until I was almost 18 months old).

I definitely do not have EDS, I’m rather inflexible and my skin is definitely not stretchy (it’s hard to grab it to try and stretch it), although both of my elbows hyperextend.
I do not have autism, after watching family videos of me as a toddler/young child and not having any autism-specific traits, although I was just diagnosed with ADHD, at the age of 22 (F).

Interestingly, all of my siblings and both of my parents fit the criteria for ADHD, but only one sibling, my youngest, fits the criteria for autism (she was very clearly different as an toddler/young child from the rest of us, and her autism is extremely high functioning).

So I was prescribed 10 mg methylphenidate 2 x daily. It fixed my low muscle tone. It also releases the muscles in my back which felt like a hard rock. I can feel my vertebrae in my lower back now. But my limbs, core muscles are “tighter” and I tire less, can use my strength with way less effort. I do things and expect to tire soon, but don’t. I can stand up for extended periods without feeling the need to lean on anything.

This effect wears off as the methylphenidate wears off. Other people have commented that I hold my body differently and look less “floppy” when I take it.

I just really want to understand WHY this could be happening.Is it dopamine? Noradrenaline? What could I be lacking that my muscles need to regulate their tension?",Low muscle tone - stimulant medication “fixes” it while it’s in effect?

Last year he was put on anti depressants because he was depressed as all his friends were achieving goals in life and he was not able to.

A week after the start of anti depressants, he wasn't able to balance himself properly. The doctor said to continue the medicine as he'll adjust to it. 2-3 months later and now his condition had worsened.

He constantly keeps his head flexed. When I ask him to lift it up he does but within 5 seconds would again flex. Balance is very poor. He's falling constantly and moving backward. Speech has become fast and volume of speech slow. This all started after the antidepressants. Now he just keeps his head flexed all the time. MRI showed nothing, everything was normal. Doctor stopped the anti depressants and said to wait a few months for it to wash out. Now it's been 6 months and he's just the same.

I started working with him a week ago. I tried to make him stand and he's constantly raising his heel upward. I made him stand with the support of a wall and he's constantly just raising his heels. We asked him to stop and he said I'm unable too. This happens when I wask him to stand straight. When he tales support of wall and moves his legs a little in the front, it doesn't happen.

353,physiotherapy,"Hi. I am currently at the end of my 3rd year of completing a BA in kinesiology at York University and need some advice for the application process. I have a competitive 3.8+ GPA but almost little to no extracurricular experience. I am also waiting to sign up for the CASPER and take it at some point this summer. 

I have completed all of the pre-requisite courses for programs in my second and third year and will probably be taking bird courses and other courses needed to complete my program in my 4th year. I understand that some schools only look at your GPA for the last 2 years of the program so would they care if some of these are just bird courses?

This summer I will be volunteering at a physio clinic for shadowing experience and am hoping to complete 300+ hours and obtain a letter of recommendation from the physiotherapist. I am also looking to get a letter of recommendation from one of my professors that I closely worked with in a smaller course and am looking to join one of his research programs in the upcoming academic year. I  have another letter of recommendation from my previous job at a country club (Although it was a paid job and unrelated to health care). 

I will look to join some clubs at school and gather more volunteer experience in various fields. Because of my weak extracurricular experiences thus far should I look to take a year after I graduate just to strengthen this area before applying?? 

Since GPA is not really an issue for me how many volunteer experiences and hours at clinics should I aim for to have a realistic chance at getting into a school in Ontario?

I am also open to studying abroad but I would prefer to stay in Ontario since it would cut my costs substantially.

354,physiotherapy,"Hi, so I know this is long but I need to explain the only injury that I’ve had that could possibly contribute to this.

So when I was 15 (now23) I was playing a basketball game and I slammed directly on my pelvis from behind from a height onto a wooden court, I ended up getting an X-ray that day with the outcome of a small space that was created in between my L5 and sacrum which then caused my right sacroiliac joint to *for lack of a better word* rub and grind This lead to pain if standing for long periods of time or even bending or twisting the wrong way on my lower back/lumbar area, I could do certain stretches and physiotherapy every now and then and that helped but this pain lasted about 4 years before it sort of just stopped being an issue and now rarely ever feel pain and I am talking like 2 times a year at most.

I’ve been stretching everyday for about a year now and I’ve noticed that my right hamstring (dominant leg) is much more tighter than my left? I have very good mobility in both my left and right legs but when it comes to my right hamstring I can’t seem to get as deep in the stretch as I do on the left side without my foot pointing and my knee lifting. I don’t feel any pain as though I know I am at the end of my stretch I just cannot get my leg to stay straight. I can also feel my hamstring is very tense when I am in this position compared to my left.

Could my previous injury have caused my hips to have some kind of lateral tilt? Or maybe my body has grown into a position that were the pain is now no longer an issue and it’s caused flexibility issues on the right side? 

Any advice would be great :)",Uneven hamstrings?

356,physiotherapy,"I would really appreciate some advice on the best course of action for me. If you take the time to read this, thank you.


I finished uni a few years ago (I am now 25). 1 year into my English-related course, I took a year out due to a bereavement. When I came back I wanted to change my course to something health/fitness/sports related, but 1. my uni wouldn’t allow me to change courses and 2. I didn’t have any relevant A-levels. 


I finished my course anyway, and ended up with a BA in a subject I’m no longer interested in. I needed a job and to get on my feet after struggling with my mental health for so long. I didn’t want to get a job related to my degree, and I was too lacking in confidence at the time to do a personal training course, so I got a job as a lifeguard as it’s a vaguely relevant qualification that I already had. 


My workplace is a military clinical facility that rehabs injured and disabled vets/athletes/complex trauma cases etc. I’ve been really inspired by what I’ve seen while working here and I’d really like to get involved, but don’t know how to start. The only xp I have that could be relevant is a few years volunteering at a disabled swimming group where I taught and supported in the water.


I feel that younger me’s career choices are going to hinder me greatly. I feel like I’d struggle to get qualified in anything without even a single relevant A-level to my name.


Today I got talking to one of the physios that works here, who said I could potentially observe or shadow them when I have free time (there’s lots of downtime in my job) and maybe even get work experience here at some point. 


In terms of getting qualified, they suggested that I could first do a biology A-level (which I didn’t know I could do) and focus on getting experience as mentioned, and at some point in the future I would need to get a degree. 

The idea that maybe there could be a way for me to do this after all has made me really excited as there isn’t much opportunity for career progression as a lifeguard. Even more so because it would seem that I could potentially do a lot of the learning etc while still working my current job due to the amount of downtime I get here.

So I'm currently (was) a final year physio student in Australia, with only a few (3) placements to get my degree. I have not been involved in my course for 2 years, due to various personal reasons that precluded me from taking part in placement. I.E I completely bottled it on placement.

Overall, was disappointed by the minimal support provided by my university, and looking towards a clean slate.

During this time, I have moved out of state (to Qld), found F/T work, purchased a home and am currently plodding along. However, I can't help think about what could have been, had I held things together in my final year. Anybody here transferred across physio courses very late in their degree, I have pretty much all my credits up to 2 placement subjects with a solid GPA?

362,physiotherapy,"Aged care is moving funding models from ACFI to AN-ACC in October this year. Under the new funding model allied health will not be funded at all. My current employer has said residential aged care facilities will still require physios and allied health to come in and recommend changes etc. But this is a significant drop in labour needed and there’s nothing in this funding model that states nursing homes need to outsource their physios like they were supposed to with the previous funding model - so wouldn’t they just hire one themselves? 

I work for a large allied health company with over 600 clinical staff nation wide. There are several (at least 5 come to mind off the top of my head with 100s of smaller ones servicing aged care as well) of these in Australia. According to the Physiotherapy board there’s ~33000 physios in Australia with general registration. 

The aged care sites I’m working at have already said they’ll no longer require our services instead relying on their diversional therapists to do tai chi with their residents. In my opinion the new model will create a situation where resident deconditioning will be financially encouraged more than it already is.

I've been at my current job for nearly two years now and recently have been really struggling.

The husband and wife owners are very experienced but are very manual handling based.
Acupuncture, cupping and ultrasound are used very frequently. Manual therapy is the preferred treatment method and exercise is patient homework more than an in session treatment. I don't agree with this approach. 

I recently made a mistake giving strengthening exercises a sooner than the surgeon wanted. I gave the exercises at this stage by using a different surgeons guidelines as this surgeon didn't provide any. 
Since this incident I have had 4 messages through our notes system, a 30 minute review with one of the owners, watched a rotator cuff repair with the surgeon (who was super nice and was helpful) and written a reflective statement all in the span of about 3 weeks. 

I was sent the points for my performance review and this patient was brought up again. They want me to have weekly session with either of the owners cause they feel ""I might think I'm doing the right thing but the patient may not feel like I am"". Essentially they think I don't know what I'm doing. 

Over the last 2 years I can't say I've had any major issues other than the bosses expecting manual therapy be provided in every single session. Which honestly I don't do because my clinical reasoning says that's not appropriate for every session. 
One other issue is my follow up to initial patient ratio isn't good enough i.e I need to be seeing more follow up appointments. 


At this stage my confidence is shot, my motivation is at an all time low and I'm at the point where I just pack it in and change career.

I used different pain killers, Muscle Relaxants nothing worked, I take **Cyclobenzaprine** and go sleep. When I wake up no pain no stiffness no stress perfectly fine for the day.

So my questions.

1) While I am taking this muscle relaxant my neck doesn't hurt and Hernia gets relief , no pressure so do you think hernia gets heal? Or hernia stays as it is and doesn't get healed.

2) If it doesnt heal my hernia does that mean I will use this medicine forever? 

Thank you for your kind answer :)",Do you think it will heal it or just pain relief ?

Since graduating, I have actually worked longer in the healthcare industry for 5 years as compared to the fitness industry (2 years). Specifically in the allied health department, having job-shadow occupational therapists and physiotherapists for so long made me want to pursue the physio pathway. I have actually enrolled into a BSc in Physiotherapy in an NZ university, however, due to their strict border closures, I have wasted so much time waiting for entry into the country.

439,physiotherapy,"I had a patient recently who had some clear impairments but no obvious injury.

This young patient - who runs short distances 3 times and does a fair bit of strength work - complained about feeling ""unsteady"" or just ""uncomfortable"" on their right leg whilst walking or running. They seemed fixated on how asymmetrical their gait feels too.

In terms of pain, they had a lot of R) foot pain, mostly in the toes and midfoot. There's also some anterior thigh+knee pain during deep squats.

**The really weird thing is watching them walk:** Their L) leg does everything normally however during R) stance, they kinda 'snap' into posterior pelvic tilt and their knee hyperextends slightly as they enter hip extension. Note they *don't* hyperextend from the point of heel-strike like you'd see with tight calves or hemiparesis.

We tried some gait training and whilst he could control his pelvis better, it still felt ""off"" to him.

In terms of impairments:

* Very tight hamstrings: \~30 on the straight leg raise. This is the only unambiguous finding. Tighter on the right.
* Potentially weak hamstrings: Visually they look weak but he could just barely do a nordic curl and had 4/5 for an oxford muscle test.
* No issues with glute control. The patient does a lot of abduction work on their own and could easily do single leg squats, almost to parallel

445,physiotherapy,"I don't believe this is asking for medical advice, rather physiotherapeutic practice, but please let me know if you believe I have broken rule 1.

I went to a physio once and she used some thermo-conducting cream on my swollen patella post fracture and used ice directly on the skin to bring the swelling down quickly.

At home I have always used frozen gel packs however she told me that they are ""warmer than zero degrees"" which has me confused in terms of thermodynamics and also in terms of being healthy for the skin/site.


My conventional knowledge is RICE and that combining compression and ice is effective. which is that you should usually have a layer between the ice and the injury, and then you can tightly tie on that ice.

Now thermodynamics is confusing, because regardless of what temperature you freeze a gel ice pack at, the pack itself will be freezer temperature. However I think there's some confusion in terms of how the cold is transferred. For a lunchbox, you don't want a fast conduction rate, getting your food really cold to start the day, and thus gel is a great option.

Whereas for a site injury, water has two great advantages if ""really cold"" is desired:

It melts quickly, which causes all the ice to get slightly colder (thermodynamic principle, the warmest part of the ice will melt, leaving colder ice). It also leaves water, which is a fantastic conductor and directly on the skin can sit in your pores, and then again when it warms up, it will evaporate, leaving the colder water on your skin.

What do physiotherapists use, and should I avoid ice ""packs"" for sports injuries?

The bigger issue is that the idea of **compensation = pain** has very little basis, at least when talking about **bilateral** differences.

I suspect my patient today had a patella dislocation (injury happened in December 2021) but she only sought treatment for it now as the pain in her knee is starting to bug her.

She had a direct fall onto her knee, felt like something popped out of place but was able to weightbear on the leg immediately after the fall, and sometimes feels like the knee is giving in. 

Did all the specific tests for the patellofemoral joint (had pain with compression, positive apprehension with lateral patella glide) and her patella is located more laterally and slightly superiorly compared to the other knee. She has now developed somewhat of a valgus of this knee (hip adduction and internal rotation with the knee now looking more 'knock-knee' than the other knee). Her foot is also more pronated on the affected side compared to the unaffected side. 

She also complained of posterior knee pain (at the pes anserinus insertion). She has pain with isometric knee flexion. Is it possible she developed a compensatory pes anserinus tendiopathy due to altered biomechanics caused by the maltracking of the patella as it's no longer in it's groove?

Aside from that, does anyone know which treatments I can use? It's months later now and usually this is treated conservatively but that option is obviously out the window. I did some TP release of her hamstrings, some VMO and glute medius strengthening. Any other ideas on what I could do to reduce pain and return the patella to it's correct position or is strengthening to improve active stability the only option here?",Can you get a pes anserinus (hamstring) tendinopathy due to a untreated patella dislocation?
486,physiotherapy,"(Apologies if my terminology is off, it varies a lot within this topic)

To my knowledge, accessory glide mobilisations are mostly a pain-relief tool and a way of increasing ROM in very acute or restricted patients. It is not something I use in my sub-acute setting.

Those who do use it, tell me it has 3 mechanisms of working:

1. \`**Pain gate:** When we take the joint through these specific movements, we stimulate mechanoreceptors which inhibit nociceptor activity associated with that movement, allowing the glide to occur with less restriction from muscle spasms.
2. **Mobilising/stretching the capsule:** Sometimes a glide is restricted because the capsule is tight in a specific direction. By manually moving the joint, we stretch the tight fibres much like you stretch a tight muscle.
3. **a bit of placebo**

Number **2** is what confuses me. I don't know if there's any evidence that you can actually affect this change in the capsule with these movements. **Does anybody know of any literature exploring this question?**

It's an important question because I've had many patients with obvious, acute capsule tightness but not much pain. These patients don't need the pain relief effects of an accessory mob but if point **2** is true, than it's still worth doing.

I've got nothing against the technique, I just don't do much manual therapy.",Is there evidence that accessory glide mobilisations actually change/affect the joint capsule?

508,physiotherapy,"Pardon my language but I'm not sure what's the technical term for that feeling you get when you maximally activate muscle to the point of getting that cramping feeling, hence, ""the squeeze.""

I once had this patient who obviously had weak calves which were holding him back from running. We did some other things (hip strength, running form education, etc) but when it came to prescribing calf raises, there was an odd issue.

He could do both **single** and **double** leg calf raises to similar degrees but he said that he ""doesn't feel his calves tensing"" during the single leg raise. Looking at his form, he was cheating *a bit* during the single leg raise - but it was a tiny difference.

I figured that his subjective feeling of muscle exertion was a sign of better control and activation and so we stuck to **double leg** calf raises.

&amp;#x200B;

This got me wondering about all the times we tell patients to ""squeeze"" their glutes for dear life during a bridge. Is getting that maximal activation more important than just sheer weight?

After 10 months of conservative care, I ended up getting a L5/S1 microdiscectomy &amp; partial-laminectomy end of Aug-2021. I did not have shooting pain but did have sciatica and major discomfort - it did severely impact my quality and life, thus, moved forward with surgery. 

Post-surgery. I was referred to a well-known PT in the city that has experience dealing with back surgeries and started working with him mid Oct-2021 (6 weeks post-surgery) and have been working with him to this present day. As someone who had (still have a little) PTSD trusting PTs due to my conservative care phase, I told myself for my post-op rehab, I will fully follow whatever this PT tells me to do. I see myself as a stoic individual, but I even cried in his office about how tough this entire pre-&amp;-post-op process has been for me two months ago.

So I'm \~6 mths post-surgery, 4 mths so far working with this PT. From day 1, my rehab program consisted of core strengthening (dead bug, bird dog, plank variations etc). At my weekly 30 mins follow-ups, we catch-up for a few minutes, he might re-assess a few things but we go to the gym area and a workout that's **different** than my take-home exercises. My exercises have remained the **exact same** for 4 months and I've trusted the process this entire time as I am feeling better but in recent weeks some questions/comments have popped up in my head:

* BOTH my hamstrings are extremely tight since my initial injury, 9 months before surgery and 6 months after surgery. For the past 15 months I can't bend past my knees (before seeing a physio for the first time in Nov-2020 who messed me up, I could almost touch my toes). My current PT told me at the beginning ""you have to keep strengthening your core, so your brain will turn off the ""alarm"" and will then release the hamstrings"". It's been 17 weeks since starting post-op rehab and I'm at the exact same place, can't bend past knees. My core is definitely so much stronger now than it was before, it's just frustrating that I haven't seen an ounce of progress in this area when my core is indeed strong af now.
* I've always wondered why I haven't gotten ANY progression exercises for my rehab, but again I thought this is just the progress. I was catching up with an old school mate who just started practicing at his clinic and he happened to just check me out real quick and said that my psoas muscle on the right is extremely tight and these exercises I were given for 4 months straight with no change is not going to address ""neural tension"". This further amplified my lingering concerns.
* I feel scared/uncomfortable to ask questions anymore. I previously asked ""What is the framework in my rehab from an high-level view, is it XYZ step 1 then once we hit those boxes, it's XYZ step 2?"" OR ""what else can be done to address this issue or that issue"" and I've always been given, ""keep doing the core exercises"" as a response. Obviously there's more instances but I don't think you want to know all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a people-pleaser/shy. There's this other physiotherapist I want to try that works at a good clinic, but I can tell from social media my current PT and him follow each other. I just don't want to disrespect my current PT by going to him, but I just want to get a second opinion especially since I've been doing the same stuff for 4 months straight and am asked to continue to do so moving forward. I also don't want to waste the second PTs time for a second opinion if the industry doesn't really like to do that (Idk?).

What are your thoughts? Should I stick it out with my current PT? Or reach out to the one I want to see? I've been really stressed about this for a few weeks and I honestly lost a bit of confidence in my current one. Am I just being overly stressed for no reason?

542,physiotherapy,"Hi.  I applied to Western and Queen's only.  I only have &lt;50 hours of physio-related volunteering.  It was at one clinic and I only did admin work there and cleaning...they said no to shadowing due to covid restrictions.  They were the only place to accept me out of 100+ clinics I applied to (many cited COVID as the reason).  I obviously didn't use them as a reference in my application as they didn't get to know me much.  I am concerned this will severely hinder my chances of admission...

I have plenty of non-physio experience.  They aren't healthcare related though.  With at-risk youth, after-school programs, big brothers big sisters, food delivery during COVID (all unpaid).  One unpaid position where I provided direct care to a kid with a disability.  All were several years in length.

CASPER is 4th quartile.  sGPA is 3.88.  I know those are above average stats (I hope they are), but Queen's looks heavily at your supp app and from what I heard reject many who have very high GPAs. They also prefer if one of your references is a PT (which I don't have). Western I feel is where my better chance is as I think they put more emphasis on your sGPA.

544,physiotherapy,"So, Feb 2021, I broke my dominant humerus. Ortho fucked up but that's another story. Because of the displacement of my fracture, I lost the majority of my triceps, and it turns out also some of the muscle round my shoulder. I have a dropped shoulder, basically. Not sure if it's the deltoids or trapezoid that has atrophied but I've got missing flesh under my skin. 

The physio I got last summer focussed on just mobility and not actually building up the muscles that I lost. I had to stop going to physio because it turns out my fracture hasn't actually healed so I'm waiting on surgery. 

My question is, are physiotherapists supposed to work on building up atrophied muscle or just mobility of joints? I need to know if it would be a good idea to look into PT to help build my muscles back up after I've had surgery and physio later this year.

It is a guy who really seems like he know what to do and he told me that I should stop doing exercise on core. That muscles should be liquid and should take care of the most important thing- bones. What do you guys think about that? He showed me exercise where i am lying and have my legs on cylindrical fitball. He is saying that it is more about feeling. He shows me how to lay and how to decompose the weight. How to play with rotations in my body. It felt good at the beggining. I also learned a little how to do it at home. He is very expensive so I can rarely come to him. Right now I do not know what to do because I do not feel good. I feel weak and I don't know to do it as good as with him.

571,physiotherapy," I am coming from the perspective of a physiotherapy student in the Netherlands at this issue. This is an essay on the deliberate use of placebos in treatment of patients. There are some trends I am responding to that I noticed in my field and adjacent professions. There are wavering trends and misconceptions about Placebo use in treatment of people who's illness is hard to treat effectively with conservative treatment. So is there a place for placebos as a treatment option? From a therapist perspective telling your patient that there is nothing you can do for them is hard. So we have some pressure to deliver something rather than nothing. From a scientific perspective placebos are an important cut of line for the value of a given treatment. Placebos are a mix of many different effects that influence a patients reporting. They happen by them-self and because of this they often are the only thing comparing groups show as a sign of improvement. Some studies looked at administering a placebo treatment by themselves and it looks like they only have a provable benefit if there is deception on the outset. But why not consider this as a form of treatment? In other words Why not deceive our patients? To start I will lay out the case pro placebo. If there is nothing better to do the case seems best to be made. We see placebo groups in every good double blinded trial. The groups receive a pill with no effect and/or a talk about the upsides of some unexplained intervention as a beneficial one for their problems. In these groups the positive effects are often attributed for the pro side to the placebo debate as a mind over matter effect. In other words patients become better because they will it so in one way or another. Up front I would inject that many things do get better by them-self, but the pro side often frames these effects of time as being supplemented or even mainly driven by patient believes. So why not use these effects to woo patients into feeling better? Even if they happen on their own. Giving a woo explanation for them might make patients feel better, because they take note of them. These outcomes might be hard to measure scientifically, but making patients feel better might be worth while by any means.    The first thing that comes to my mind is the question of transparency. Most treatments have well studied effects and side effects and patients are informed upfront about them. With a placebo and a deception we could try the same thing. Informing or asking the patient about the use of deception in our treatment, but that would certainly be a weird discussion. Leading to a possible failure to make the placebo work its mind over matter effect. The trust between the therapist and the patient would probably be harmed and the belief to be treated by a quack can cause the opposite, a nocebo effect, to take hold. So there is no good way to deliver the placebo supplement in a ethical way. Given everything at most this turns out as a wash. Even besides this interviewing skills focused on post treatment reflection can have the same benefit of making the patient aware of the improvement over time without having to explain them in some forced way. The question is secondary if you think about the actual proposal to use deception upfront. What if you are actually deceiving yourself by just forcing the patient to give you better outcomes, because of the social pressures. Patients might think that you want to hear that your treatment whatever it might be was effective. Leaving your practice not really being helped. Instead they just make you think that you did some good, maybe because of the level of enthusiasm needed to deliver your mind over matter supplement. So we wouldn’t know in the end. From all angles this question of transparency makes me positive that placebos with a pep talk flavor are no good for clinical practice. If we want to do good, being honest is the best thing to do: “I am sorry but I don’t know if there is an effective treatment for your condition.” This is the course of action that helps patients become aware of their actual circumstances. The earlier this happens the easier it will be to face reality or actually notice when things improve for any reason. Watering down this clarity will not help to find things that are helpful and in the end nothing works better than knowing that placebos come along for the ride either way.",On Placebos as treatment

574,physiotherapy,"Hey all, 
     I’m in the midst of a pretty complicated predicament right now and am looking for some advice. So I’m born and raised in America, completed a bachelors in biology at a university there and was planning on continuing my study into a DPT program. However, once I graduated (December 2020) my mother wanted to move to Australia (we’re also Australian citizens) so off we 
went. I missed the application cycle for bachelor of physio programs in 2021 so I instead applied for the 2022 cycle and would be starting the program this year in late Feb/ early March. However, my mom now wants to move back and I know I’m going to end up working in America once I finish my degree. Since she wants to go back, I am now applying to American universities and have deferred from university here for the time being. 

My question is, knowing that I will be working in America, which option makes the most sense? I could start studying now, be done in 4 years, then move back to America and spend about a year or so completing the licensing exams and completing the t-DPT program. Or, I could apply this year for American universities, start next year and finish in 4 years as well and start working right away. Regardless, both options take the same amount of time and I would start working at roughly 28 years old which isn’t bad at all. The Australian option is much cheaper with lower “interest rates”, but I’m not sure if going to an American university is the safer (less headache) option in the long run, or does studying in Australia then transferring over to America not matter as much as I think it does?

Has anyone studied in Australia and then worked in America? Any advice would be appreciated! 

Oh also, since I already completed a 4-year degree in America I wouldn’t have to make up much classes if any since I already have all the prerequisites for a DPT there. 

Also for clarification I am applying for bachelors programs instead of masters programs since my major in biology barely covered any pre-requisites for a masters program in physiotherapy here in Australia. I could take the prerequisite courses then enroll in a masters program, but at that point I’d already be halfway through my bachelors.

587,physiotherapy,"I was prescribed with some physiotherapy sessions due to my extreme stiff back in the morning, and my physiotherapist has made me do the jefferson curl, which seems to be helping me quite a bit. But sadly my sessions ended before even I realized I had a couple of questions regarding the exercise.

So I know I start by bending my neck downward, rounding my shoulder and focus on folding my back, working my way down vertebrae by vertebrae. Now in the effort to make sure I start bending the one above before the next one, I not only squeeze my quads and glute -which I was told is necessary to keep my legs straight- but also embrace my core and contract the abs to initiate the bending motion; sort of like a reverse leg raise. Only when I reach as low as I can go, would I exhale to loosen up and go a bit further down. The same with the way back up. The question is; am I supposed to keep my core loose and let the gravity do the work, like a controlled fall of my torso, and purely focus on the leg/hip drive on the way back up while maintaining the looseness at my core?

Previously with my back / spine and now with my neck, as I've been strengthening previous severe weaknesses and mobility has been (significantly) increasing, I have these little 'crackling' feelings and sounds when I stretch / rotate etc. 

They are NOT at all painful and in fact are sort of nice feeling so I am not worried at all but simply wondering what it might be. They are vaguely reminiscent of cracking your knuckles but a slightly smaller and softer sound (I don't know if anyone can hear it except me 'internally', I don't have anyone to ask!) and of course I can do it on demand (unlike my knuckles). 

The closest analogy(?) I can think of IRL that it reminds me of would be something like old leather, that's quite stiff, but as you start to flex it, it creaks and begins to crack as the flexibility returns (does that make sense lol?)

That said, I need some reality checks... Give it to me straight, what - from your industry experience and knowledge - makes the below goal either realistic or unrealistic? Thanks all in advance. 🙏 

Imagine the career route:

• Study and get qualified
• Gain experience 
• Start a clinic and transition to self-employment
• Focus on marketing and content creation via YouTube, Podcasts, and a Website, and specialise in a niche (such as Sports Physiotherapy)
• Hire other PT's to reduce business' dependence on your presence / hourly services
• Also outsource content creation administration and ""grime"" work
• Take the CEO role and expand, opening other clinics, hiring more, or even offering mobile services with more employees to increase reach and client base
• Now, I own a growing (one day big) business, and can focus on the bigger picture. The business doesn't NEED me - the managers and employed staff handle the running of the business, and I guide it and make sure the cash flow is positive. Thus, financial freedom has been achieved from the business income and from wise investments (property, crypto, funds, etc.)...

Hard work and learning are no-brainers here. It's a competitive and changing world, but seemingly it's also one demanding more physio's.

612,physiotherapy,"Hi everyone, a little background on myself, some general life story spiel and perspective on my situation in the first 2 paragraphs; if you're not interested skip to the third paragraph for the meat of my question!

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 24, finished year 12 however didn't get an ATAR because I didn't complete the required number of units for one, I took the bare minimum amount of classes in year 11/12 and picked stupid subjects like history and retail studies instead of math and science. Unfortunately as an immature kid with no father figure around and no discipline from my mum I slacked hard and took the path of least resistance. I was the kind of student who got reports every year along the lines of ""Bright/Intelligent but talks too much/needs to focus more..."" I live in an immense amount of regret and shame from my incompetence at school and have yearned desperately to rectify that in adulthood.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea what I wanted to do for work when I graduated so I just followed the easy money and went into warehouse work not long after graduating and spent the last 6 or so years doing that. About 2 years in I busted my back up quite badly doing manual labour and went to see a private practice physiotherapy clinic about it for a few months. This is when I realised I may of found my calling for life, I loved going there, I loved the vibe of the clinic, I thought that the people there had such an awesome job. I absorbed all the knowledge they imparted on me in my recovery plan and still incorporate a lot of their stretches and exercises in my daily routine. It led me to look into the ""how"" and ""why"" of exercising, stretching and injury management/prevention and develop an interest in science backed practice. I'm a very active and health conscious individual outside of work, practically live in the gym. The staff in that clinic seemed like \*my\* people if that makes sense, obviously a lot better educated then me at that! Unfortunately due to low self esteem and guilt over my terrible academic performance I didn't look into this career change until last year, however the thought of doing physio never left my mind over all this time which I believe is important.

&amp;#x200B;

 I decided to take a risk this year and quit my full time warehouse job to pursue my dream of becoming a physio. These are the steps in my pathway;

 1. TAFE - doing a Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance with Physiotherapy specialisation. My idea is through doing this certificate, I gain relevant industry experience and ideally ongoing part time or casual employment as a physiotherapy assistant to pay the bills through uni. I also hope that this will make me more attractive to hire as a physiotherapist assistant in the first place then a bachelor of physio student fresh out of school with no work experience as the TAFE certificate comes with 3 weeks of work placement with NSW health which leads to ongoing employment for most students post study.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Uni - I will then do the Western Sydney University integrated diploma to bachelor of health science degree as it's my local Uni and has no ATAR requirement. I aim to get excellent grades to allow me to perform an internal transfer to the bachelor of physiotherapy in my second year. If I do not achieve the required grades to transfer in my bachelor's I will complete my bachelor of health science with clinical sciences as my major which will allow me to do a postgraduate masters of physiotherapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this realistic for someone who did not get an ATAR? I realise that the bachelors of physiotherapy has one of the highest ATAR requirements out of all bachelor degrees in Australia but this is the \*only\* career in life I have ever had any passion and drive to chase. If it's impossible to become a physio without an ATAR I would appreciate being suggested some alternate career avenues that scratch the same itch or the best way to re-do my ATAR and get it high enough to do physiotherapy. I want to go to university and receive a proper education.

But.. Then I was at the gym 1.5 weeks ago approximately, and I wanted to test out the individual strength in each leg as I have imbalances due to bulging disc in my lower back, and my physio recommended that I tried testing out the difference in my muscle strength in leg press.

So, I did that. I have done 150-170kg for reps before (with both legs) and have trained for a long time consistently, so I thought 70kg would be challenging but possible. However, as tested my weak leg (and bad knee side) it was like something snapped and hurt instantly. 

Since then, I have had pain moving around the patella cap. This is in my left leg btw. It started at the bottom right, then the pain was at the left top a couple of days after, and finally today it is at the bottom right and top right.

I am a physiotherapy student from Norway in the process of writing my bachelor thesis.   
I have chosen to compare high frequency/volume with low frequency/volume in patients with subacromial pain (shoulder impingement). As of now I have only found 1 study that explicitly tries to research this:  

* Østerås, H., Torstensen, T. A., Haugerud, L., &amp; Østerås, B. S. (2009). *Dose–response effects of graded therapeutic exercises in patients with long-standing subacromial pain. Advances in Physiotherapy*

I have found other studies which has a high volume and high frequency, such as:

* Holmgren, T., Bjornsson Hallgren, H., Oberg, B., Adolfsson, L., &amp; Johansson, K. (2012). *Effect of specific exercise strategy on need for surgery in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome* 

While this trial has high load and high frequency (with good results), the focus on this study is comparing specific movements with unspecific movements. As both protocol has a high frequency. 

Both of these studies are included in a systemic review from 2020 by C. Littlewood and friends:

*  Malliaras, P., Johnston, R., Street, G., Littlewood, C., Bennell, K., Haines, T., &amp; Buchbinder, R. (2020). *The efficacy of higher versus lower dose exercise in rotator cuff tendinopathy: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials* 

And while it concludes with a mix of uncertainty and positivity, it states that more research is needed.

627,physiotherapy,"In university as well as in clinical practice (in Australia at least), we were taught that gait aids play an important role in preventing falls. During my clinics, it is standard protocol that we always place the patient's gait aid within reach. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting that older people who use gait aids actually has a higher falls risk than those who don't. 

So if we prescribe a gait aid to someone who we deem is high falls risk, wouldn't we inadvertently put them at an even higher risk? I understand the reasoning behind it (increase BOS, stability etc.), but the evidence doesn't seem to support it at all, so why give it in the first place? There's even evidence to support the hypothesis that using a gait aid impedes compensatory movements and increases task complexity (particularly relevant to those who are cognitively impaired).

Basically, surgery was performed by a well regarded surgeon where the Stapedius was lasered in full and the Tensor Tympani cut with a sickle knife and the tendon fibre ends cauterized with a laser to prevent re attachment! 

The goal of this surgery is to not have tendon recovery, which is quite unique, but understandable. 

The question is what will happen to the separate tendon ends over time if they are not allowed heal. Will the collagen bundles break down to nothing and will the ends die off, and if so what time period. I ask this as he can still feel spasming after severance and still experiences a humming/buzzing noise.

How? He wont explain.

I am a M23yo working as an acoustic engineer in Sydney. I have been working in this role for 1.5 years now (weird story but it started as work experience while i completed my bachelor of science). I quickly realised that the pay was quite generous, I started on 50k per year and received pay rises approximately every 6 months, the last one being September last year where I was raised to 80k (before tax and super). 

I have always desired a career in health and physio seems to fit my strengths and interests as well as having a good work-life balance. I have been accepted into the doctor of physiology masters degree at Macquarie university starting mid this year. However, after researching salaries for physios and comparing it to what I am earning now/possibly earning in the future, it is hard to commit to 3 more years of uni, only to come out the other end to earn less. Also considering what my salary could be like at my work in 3 years time.

Although I definitely dont hate it, I know that acoustic engineering is far from where I would like to spend most of my working years, although my current mindset is quite money motivated. 

I guess my questions are:
1. From a physios perspective, is a career in this field worth swapping from a job with a higher salary and going back to uni?
2. I understand it is possible, but how difficult/likely is it to reach 100k and above in this field?

660,physiotherapy,"(Please note that I'm asking if this **could** happen, every patient is different etc, etc,)

A lot of what I've been taught and read about treating ITB syndrome is somewhat anecdotal or moderate-quality evidence at best.

One thing that never seems to get brought up is the possibility that **weak quads could contribute to a symptomatically tight ITB.** The emphasis is always on glutes and core and quads are ONLY brought up under the presumption that they're tight.

I've never liked this idea of having tunnel-vision towards one particular muscle or demonising another and so it's frustrating when nobody has even tried to assess if quad weakness is involved. Consider this:

* The ITBH helps maintain lateral knee stability. If the quads are weak the knees will buckle slightly during weight-bearing. When the knee buckles, it's more likely to do so by rotating inward due to the centre of gravity being  medial to the knee. This pulls on the ITB and over time would irritate it.

It's just a hypothesis but I can't find any research or even expert opinion acknowledging it.

Does anybody have any experience with this? Critiques? Maybe some good studies to read?

Just want to ask on wearing high cut or high top shoes such as “converse high top or even high cut basketball shoes”. 

It is true that any so-called “support,” by taking over the natural role of muscle and connective tissue, will weaken your foot and ankle and this can, over time, lead to injuries. 

Arch support will weaken the foot muscles and prevent them from naturally absorbing shocks while walking or running. A tight and overbuilt high-top will do the same to your ankle. 

Over time, your ankle will become weaker and be subject to ankle sprains, which can be hard to heal.

702,physiotherapy,"Hi all, 

First of all, I'm NOT asking for medical advice on my situation. I understand that's not what this subreddit is for. I'm just giving some context to why I'm asking. 

My father had a serious stroke in June and lost most of the movement in his right side. Fortunately he still has sensation and some movement. I've tasked myself with trying to aid in his physical recovery. 

Something I've noticed about some of the physio recommendations we've been given by practitioners and by resources online is that there seems to be a lack of practical programming around physiotherapy (at least to the public). 

For example I was given a page of exercises we can do by physio when he came out of hospital, but that's just it - exercises. No indication of how many to do or how to progress them. Basic movement patterns like stretching your arm or extending your knee.  

I lift weights personally, and a basic principle of getting stronger (regardless of where you start from) is that you need to have a program, you need to log your progress and you ultimately need to progress in some measurable way. Do heavier weights or more volume of work so that you actually get stronger instead of plateau. If you go in and do 10 squats 3x a week at the same weight and never anything more you will never get any stronger even if you do it for years, you'll just get bored.

If I didn't know that through my own physical training, I'd probably just get my dad to do the movements on the sheet of paper a couple of times a day. And I imagine after several weeks or months of not seeing much improvement I'd begin to think it's hopeless. 

I guess I'm just venting a little here as that's been my experience - Everything I find online gives me movement exercises but no program or progression plan. I ended up putting one together myself.

Lots of my classmates have some really outdates beliefs ranging from ""bad posture causes pain"" &amp; ""You need to activate your glutes for x amount of time before x activity"". 

All the way to more debated things like whether massage is a useful treatment method and other things about manual therapy.

We are all 1st years so we're not prepared (or also willing to in our spair time) look through and critique studies. So when we discuss stuff like like ""bad posture=pain"" I can't just recommend studies from physio's I follow for the above reason.

How should one go about discussing these types of ideas with colleagues/classmates? 


I assumed the Socratic method of just questioning would be the best approach but at times I run into road blocks in terms of my knowledge as I'm on the same playing field as they are.

I also find that these beliefs are deeply rooted within them as when their physio ""fixed"" them they used x method &amp; I hear a lot of ""well my physio told me that __ does this"" *Insert ridiculous outdated idea/treatment method.

711,physiotherapy,"For the memory to store anything, it had to be picked up. For it to give anything, it has to be given. These, by the picker and the giver, become consistent in knowing and interoception, theoretically.

The memory has stores. These stores are grouped by similarities. Rice can be grouped with noon — if rice is often served at lunch. Rice has its own store in the memory. New stores are created by the picker, but groupings often change.

If rice now gets served at dinner, the picker slowly takes it to the group of dusk. Rice could also be grouped with a cool chef, or a certain situation that happened in the time that rice was served and so on.

In a continuous process, stores are created, groups are made and changed. This, theoretically, can be described as a summary for what neuroplasticity also means.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitivescience/comments/rrdskv/memories\_or\_just\_thoughts\_of\_the\_past/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cognitivescience/comments/rrdskv/memories_or_just_thoughts_of_the_past/)

The brain changes with function — true, but function become inputs that go to a memory store, then group, so that it can be given, including its sequence — mindlessly — after a while.

The base camp of neuroplasticity is the memory.

There is the concept of handedness, right hand dominance for some, left for others, with a few ambidextrous. Handedness — or by extension, laterality — can be explained as a thought function.

In the theory of the rules of neurons, there is a thought box and a memory box. The thought box has entry ports where everything is converted to thought. This includes motor functions, sensory, physical reality, internal systems operations and so on.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/rgekso/youre\_not\_seeing\_youre\_thinking\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomThoughts/comments/rgekso/youre_not_seeing_youre_thinking_theory/)

So each eye has its own entry port, each leg, each hand, ears and so on. If it is, it has an entry port.

However, why do things convert to thought, or how?

If the memory has a store for rice, or picks up information on locations, or knows about homeostasis, the memory has a uniform unit of storage. This unit, according to this theory, is thoughts.

So the thought equivalent of anything is what goes to the memory to allow that thing to be known and give how to relate with it: walls, roads, floor, and so on, become thoughts to guide how to be cautious.

The memory stores thoughts or its form.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/neurobiology/comments/rj9lyk/low\_access\_to\_memory\_not\_just\_loss\_in\_dementia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurobiology/comments/rj9lyk/low_access_to_memory_not_just_loss_in_dementia/)

Naturally, one hand has precise functionality than the other. This function can be described as thought convertibility. When one hand writes, it is stable and coordinated, when the other does, it is awry and squiggly.

The entry port of that dominant hand has packed shapes, better rotation, often bigger and longer than that of the weaker hand. If their entry ports are adjacent, one is dominant, the other is inferior.

The dominant hand sends finessed thoughts. Whatever the memory knows comes out better with that hand. Writing can be done with the toes — on sand, or with other parts of the body if the way to do it is known.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologyresearch/comments/rhxmvm/multisensory\_integration\_is\_predicated\_on\_thoughts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologyresearch/comments/rhxmvm/multisensory_integration_is_predicated_on_thoughts/)

Knowing is the memory. Since writing was learned or picked up, it can be given to do on paper, on sand, or signing in the air.

Now, using the weaker hand or any other part of the body not adapted to a function would make the entry port begin to open and send thoughts to the memory.

The memory would pick it up, create or adjust a store, then attach it to the groups of how that thing is regularly done.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Biophysics/comments/rumclc/perceptual\_predictions\_predictive\_coding\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biophysics/comments/rumclc/perceptual_predictions_predictive_coding_by/)

So writing a letter or figure with the weaker hand gets the store of that hand grouped with writing, as well as stores of what to write.

Theoretically, thought box entry ports, memory box stores, groups, picker-giver, explains neuroplasticity.

Entry ports change with function, so do stores and new groups.

In rehabilitation, it can be described as trying to get the entry ports to open so thoughts can be converted.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for\_mental\_health\_cognitive\_triangle\_assumptions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for_mental_health_cognitive_triangle_assumptions/)

In this model, using a hand or moving a leg is by the action of the throwers of the thought box.

The hand does as wanted and as enabled, while this becomes a thought that goes to the memory to say, this is being done.

During stroke or some forms of hemiplegia, the hand may no longer be enabled especially by the action of the throwers, and the ability to have their use converted to thought desiccates.

I'm 32 and about 2 years ago my neck started cracking / crunching when I turn my head to the left. It happens every time I do this movement so it isn't likely to be gas bubbles. I have not had a significant physical injury that could have brought it on, and given that I'm still quite young I doubt it is arthritis (?) . I get a lot of neck pain, although not specifically when I crack it, &amp; I believe it must be linked.
I have spent hundreds on the chiropractor, who seemed to help at first but after the first couple of sessions there wasn't any change. Now he does accupuncture to alleviate it a bit and has given me some neck exercises (the exercises do help to temporarily ease the pain), but it feels like he is treating the symptoms and not the root cause of the issue. I need someone who is going to be able to identify what is causing the cracking and fix it as it doesn't seem right at my age.

If anyone has any advice on what the right kind of medical practitioner would be for me to see (e.g. An osteopath, physio, or even another Chiropractor) then I would greatly appreciate it as I don't have a lot of money for 'trial and error' and the pain is really hindering my quality of life.

He had a tibial plateau fracture a year ago and a few other subsequent and related surgeries including a recent osteotomy about 9 weeks ago. 

He has a number of issue, one of which is poor quadricep contraction. He was also complaining about pain in his VMO today so I tried to kill two birds with one stone and went with dry needling the muscle with stim.

I hit the muscle belly at a few different spots, different angles, different depths but there was no twitching at all. He can contract the muscle a little himself but it’s pretty week. He also said he owns a TENS machine and that also doesn’t cause any contraction of his VMO. Other spots like his Gastroc work just fine. 

I’m a little perplexed why this would be the case. You would think that no matter how underused a muscle was, an external stimulation would work. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or understand why this happens.

738,physiotherapy,"hi there! i recently graduated with a Bachelor’s of Biomedical Science (initially wanted to do medicine) and now debating on whether i should do physio or OT. i got an offer for masters of OT and bachelor of physio. i am torn between the two due to reasons i’ve listed below: 

PHYSIO
Pros:
- i have a passion for human anatomy and the way the body works
- i majored in anatomy and human biology in my bachelor’s and can apply for credit for recognised learning to reduce the number of years i have to study
- PT’s are more in demand, more stable, more ‘respected’ as a profession, work more closely with doctors and nurses and are seen as the ‘doctors’ of allied health
- i work at a hospital and i’ve noticed that there are a higher number of physios so they seem to have better work relationships with one another and they have their own designated offices and gyms
- i like how physios get to move around more in the workplace instead of being stuck in a room majority of the time
- the bachelor’s degree is around 30k and much less costly than a masters
- physio is much harder to get into and i feel like i should reach my full potential since i got into it (although i know it’s more important to be passionate about something than care about prestige) 


Cons:
- i would have to study an extra 4 years (possibly 3.5 with credit) so it would take longer for me to become a physio
- i would have to do bachelor’s again
- i don’t really like the massage aspects and i am not that passionate about musculoskeletal function/sports and exercise 
- physio seems to be quite repetitive in terms of ‘following the handbook’ for patient rehab and i’m worried that i may become bored of just walking patients down a hallway all day

OT
Pros:
- i have a passion for making meaningful connections with people especially the elderly so i think helping patients perform every day tasks will be more rewarding for me
- OTs have a wider scope in terms of the patients they work with (children, people with disabilities, injured, neurological disorders, mental health, elderly) 
- there is more creativity and problem solving when devising patient rehab plans as opposed to physio
- i like the social aspects of OT and how you have to consider the patient’s whole life not just their body/injury in order to get them back home safely, i believe they also spend more time with individual patients compared to physios so i can develop patient relationships 
- the masters degree is only 2.5 years so i can become an OT in a shorter time than a PT
- it makes more sense for me to finish my bachelor’s and pursue masters instead of doing another bachelor’s
- not as physically demanding as PT

Cons:
- the masters degree is around 80k.. more than double the bachelor’s and i would be in a lot of student debt
- job demand is not as high compared to physios so it may take longer for me to get a job especially since i want to specialise in hospital care and they work more like ‘contractors’ 
- OT doesn’t really focus on human anatomy, more on neuro and fine motor skills
- i am not very comfortable in assisting with the bathing, toileting and grooming aspects of OT

any advice which can help with my decision would be much appreciated! :))

TL;DR i can’t decide between physio or OT. i love the human anatomy aspects of physio but i love the social/patient relationship aspect of OT. physio would take longer for me to complete but less expensive, OT is shorter but far more expensive",Physio or OT? (Australia)

747,physiotherapy,"Hi there, to give context I am not a medical student but very curious about human psychology and the effects it has on the body. 
I was recently reading the body keeps the score by Bessel van der kolk, and it discusses as the title suggests, trauma. 
In one specific section, his discussion of trauma and the effects it has in infancy. 
From my very small understanding of the brain, the human brain is quite reptilian until the age of two. Having read his book, I identified with some symptoms of physical abuse from his book, and how it shows in babies behaviour, but I was not abused as a child and had loving parents. 
However after speaking to my mother, she told that I was born with hip dysplasia and from the day I was born had to endure painful daily physio therapy for 9 months and wear a painful contraption to move my hips to prevent me from needing a wheelchair in adulthood. I know why my mother had to do it, but my baby brain wouldn’t have had the capacity to understand this, it would have been anticipating daily pain and fear every day for 9 months until the treatment stopped. I subsequently was quite a withdrawn, overly independent infant. 

If my hypothesis is correct, this means physio for infants that don’t have the capacity to understand what is being to done for them is very traumatic and will have the same psychological repercussions as abuse does to babies. 
This could be a strong argument against physio for babies and I wonder if it has been explored or studied.

So since  i am looking to work abroad at some point, i want to refine my reports to good quality.

i know that to get a good progress report, you need a good initial neuro assessment, use of a balance functional scale etc. Can someone give me a pdf or example of how they do the reports in your own country.

Dear r/physiotherapy Redditors,

im from Germany and in my third year of PT School. Many of you know that in Germany Physiotherapy is not a degree but a 3 year training, which shouldnt mean that the training itself is bad it's just outdated and lacks of evidence based practices. I always thought this wouldnt bother me as much since my plan was to pursue a degree in human medicine afterwards (common practice in Germany if you dont get in with your diploma/abitur) and just use the PT training as a first dip into the medical field. 

Now, almost three years later and my exams ahead of me i cant deny that i fell in love with the therapeutic practice and i dont want to miss out on that in the future. Yet im still hungry for so much more knowledge (thanks to this sub at this point, you guys showed me that PTs also make use of the access to new knowledge and studies, this aint common practice with none of the PTs i've had mentoring me during my training, which is not to say that they werent good). 

Now im torn between a new 6,5 year degree in medschool or pursuing Physiotherapy and thats where i need your help; i know it is possible to study PT in Germany at private universities, which would have the benefit that i could work as a PT while im doing that. The only problem i have is that i havent heard a lot of positive feedback from PTs who studied PT in Germany, can someone support that?

The next option would be to study in another country, where it is common that PT is a degree. My only limitation regarding that is that i could only study in english or german speaking countries. Can some of you share your experience you've had at your school/university or even compare it to other schools you've heard about or visited?

Thank you for your answers!

And best of all, the book has been produced under a Creative Commons license, so will be entirely **free** to download.

Physiotherapy Otherwise is a book about the sociology of physiotherapy. Written by Prof Dave Nicholls, founder and chair of the Critical Physiotherapy Network, the book takes readers through a century of writing on the sociology of the professions, and shows how this literature - almost entirely ignored by physiotherapists to date - can help us understand where physiotherapy came from, why it’s facing today’s problems, and where it might be going.

The four blinded peer reviewers have described the book as ‘exemplary’, ‘highly original’, 'the single most important book in physiotherapy since physiotherapy’, a '‘must read’ for all physiotherapists’, and 'a groundbreaking, timely, and beautifully executed book’.

The book will be released in January, and there will be a Print-on-Demand option for those who want a physical copy.

Updates will be posted here on Reddit, on Fb (@DavidNicholls) and Twitter (@DaveNicholls3/@CriticalPhysio).

On one hand, landing on your forefoot mainly challenges the plantarflexors. As the heel comes down there is indeed a need for dorsiflexion but I never thought of it as active dorsiflexion, it's just eccentric calves is it not?

On the *other* hand, anterior compartment syndrome and anterior tibial stress syndrome still occur in sprinters (who are usually forefoot runners) and EMG studies (sorry I cannot remember them right now) show tibialis anterior is activated throughout most of running regardless of technique.

Would it still be optimal to prescribe them as manual therapy/exercise, or is it something you would avoid entirely.

823,physiotherapy,"Third year UK student halfway through an MSK placement just sharing some thoughts.

It's the first time I've worked in an outpatient setting so I've been learning how to manage my diary plus deal with unexpected things (e.g. appointments changing location to another site, patients not getting appointment letters, not having a clinical educator when working at another site, almost a 2 hour commute each way). Not to mention how so much is still done remotely, so I've been adapting my communication skills when assessing over the phone. It's not ideal but I understand that that's just what it's like working in a large trust and am glad to have had this kind of experience. 

That's not to say that I am getting the hang of everything else though. I find the clinical reasoning more challenging than ever. When I do a follow up and read through someone else's notes, I cannot understand how to use the info they've collected. The note might have very fine details about a specific vertebral level which, if I'm honest, freaks me out a little. I feel like anything I read about spines and nerves in the context of patient notes just goes right over my head... and with the added time pressure of keeping to 30 min appointments and having to talk through my reasoning based on those notes to my educator just makes me freeze up and go blank.

Then there's the diagnosis part of things. Perhaps I lack the knowledge or experience to come up with a label for the patient's condition. I struggle with clinical reasoning (like most students I guess!) and find that although I can identify symptoms like muscle weakness and joint instability, I miss more 'serious' things. My clinical reasoning is starting to seem a bit repetitive and basic, and I want to be able to recognise when the symptoms point to something with a more neuropathic presentation, for example. 

I'm going to spend some time going over some common conditions and split them up into groups (myelopathies, arthropathies, neuropathies) to familiarise myself with them. I write reflections but even that isn't helping as much as I'd thought it would, I just find it really hard to identify where the gaps are in my knowledge. I'm on placement with another student who is very vocal about his reasoning which I find is a constant reminder of what I'm struggling with but obviously, we're all working towards different things.

One final thing is that I'm worried that I won't be able to evidence any growth in the second half of my placement. My halfway marks are the lowest they've been, and although I'm told by my educator that this placement is a particularly challenging one it hasn't really been a source of comfort haha.

Not looking for diagnostic information, but I have a question, as a patient regarding both ESWT shockwave and ultrasound therapy.

Are these treatments painful? I don't think I have a low pain tolerance, but I could not stand even a second of ESWT - it was very painful and felt like I was being electrocuted. My foot instinctively jerked away. The physio said he had never had anyone have that reaction and that it should be tolerable. He tried two more times at lower settings, but I just couldn't take it (it brought me to tears)

We then did ultrasound, which I could bear, but it was also painful - like I was being burned, alongside slight electrical sensations.

829,physiotherapy,"Hi there! I'm a 25 yo. from the US, looking at attending a Physiotherapy program in Greece, proxy of a university in UK. My end goal is to eventually find home somewhere in the EU (Greece would be fine) so I'm not too worried about the fiasco of transferring the degree back to US, I'll deal with that when it comes. 

However, I was hoping to get a familiar set of eyes on the program before I commit. [The program is at the Mediterranean College of Greece, a private college, offering the degree through an academic partnership with the University of Wolverhampton (UK).](https://www.medcollege.edu.gr/courses/bsc-hons-physiotherapy/) Basically I would be a student of Wolverhampton in Greece - there is even an option to attend the graduation ceremony there instead.

So far the college(s) seem to be reputable but the application process has been disconcertingly easy - I was accepted within a day.  My prior education is a US high school diploma and a general associate degree with mostly chemistry courses. 

Coming from the US education system this is setting off a red flag in my mind. There was no entry exam or scrutinizing my transcripts... State side it seems like a 4 year degree is needed before you can take PT or DPT schooling too, not needing that in the UK based program is interesting. 

It says on [Wolverhampton's page](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-physiotherapy/) that the degree is accredited by:

* Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)
* ""Health and Care Professions Council, the (HCPC)""

It looks like I would then have to apply for recognition by the Panhellenic Association of Physiotherapists in Greece after receiving the degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Does the program seem to meet the standards of  BSc physiotherapy study generally?

Is a BSc of Physiotherapy any different in terms of ability than PT school in the states?

Would a masters be required after to be successful in the field?

There are many protocols out there for how to return to running after an injury and whilst they vary hugely, one thing I sometimes see (and something some therapists anecdotally stand by) is putting off running until *strict* strength criteria are met; these approaches attempt to “bulletproof” the lower limb before running even begins.

One example I learnt about during a professional development course by a physio whose name I forgot. They said that the “standard” for plantar flexion strength in runners is “doing 15 single leg bent-knee calf raises with 0.5xbodyweight added.”

The rationale for this is solid - but it’s also a pretty high standard for most. 

Not to mention, slow and heavy calf raises are a completely different beast from the fast, eccentric loads of running.

Basically: if my patient can run with decent form, should I just let them run instead of spending a month or more on prehab?

I've been considering for a while moving to the UK and working as a physio (I come from Czech Republic, studied here, currently working in Austria). How is the situation in the post Brexit UK? To be more specific, I mean especially:
How much has changed the recognition process for our job (I'd prefer to hear personal experience - according to hcpc it seems, that the only thing I need is to have a IELTS certificate of a certain level, I have to provide some documentation and I have to pay fee to start the process. Is that really it? No kind of examination of my knowledge etc? As I've gone through a recognition precess in Austria, it was within the EU, so it was kinda supported, to get through the process with ease. I provided my documents, they compared it with their requirements for the education and I only had to make a course of a lymphdrainage. As there is no such international support between the EU and the UK, I fear, that it will be more troublesome.

Another question, what is the situation there for physios? Is it a needed and well paid job? Has it anyhow changed due to Brexit? I focus on orthopaedics, currently working in a rehabilitation centre, and I'd further prefer to work in a similar place rather than in a hospital

941,physiotherapy,"I've completed 3 clinical placements and only got the following grades: 55, 58 and 58.

Placement seems to bring the grades up for most people, but for me it does the opposite. It brings my grades down.

It's starting to beat me up a bit, since a lot of other people on my course seem to perform way better and get higher grades than me.

For each placement I do make some improvements, but my last placement, I think the poor organisation skills and getting the clinical reasoning cycle the wrong way round held me back.

One of the placement module leaders at my university says the mean mark for clinical placement is 58-62. I highly doubt this is true. If this is true, it's likely because the international students bring the mean mark down significantly due to the language barrier (and a lot from my university are extremely lazy because they are RICH).

I just feel a little bit dumb if I'm going to be honest. I'm curious what sorts of grades you guys got on clinical placements as students.

I’m a 24F with no history of back pain and I went to a physiotherapist on 5th October, after having low right back pain that started aching really deep while sitting on a short car journey, and glutes/legs (mainly right) started aching a week later and the pain has been nonstop since. She checked me over and said I have hypomobile L4/L5 facet joints and ever so slight anterior pelvic tilt and was given an exercise plan consisting of lumbar and thoracic side flexion, pelvic tilt standing, glute stretch supine but was not told when to stop or when to make a following appointment.

The first day after exercise I was on a long 1hr 30min car journey and was trying to sit straight up in the car because my back began aching really bad. Every car break I began doing the lumbar side flexion, and later in the day my back began feeling like it’s burning and aching(maybe overstretching?).

I’m a 25 year old that’s considering going back to university to study physiotherapy early next year. 

I’ve already done a stint at uni for one year when I was young but didn’t take it seriously at all. I’m keen to go back now with a lot more direction and motivation. I’ve narrowed down my selection to physiotherapy because I think it would suit my personality and passions. 

I have a few questions before I make a final decision as this is 4 years of my life I won’t get back. 

1. I have read a lot of posts on this sub about the physiotherapy not being worth the investment but have noticed this is mainly users from the US where course cost seem to be a lot higher. All up it would cost me $27k to get this degree considering this do you think it is a good financial decision for me?

2. I see a lot of posts about burnout and a high turnover rate for PTs on this sub. What do you think is the reason for this? It’s kind of scares me when I’m thinking of going into this as a career.

3. Are salaries really that bad? Would it be more worthwhile to just stick at a job and work my way up through a company? 

4. What are career growth opportunities like over read a lot about there being a low ceiling once you’ve graduated? This isn’t a problem for me as I’m not just in it for the money but would obviously like to upskill and progress throughout my career. 

5. Is there anything you wish you knew before going down the career path of a PT? Would love just some general advice around the career to help me make my decision.

I have been diagnosed with central sensitivity / fibromyalgia for about four years now.  I take a ton of neuropathic pain pills and cannabis to get by day to day, and had pretty much resigned myself to being trapped in a downhill marriage with nothing but pain to look forward to.

Cue the physio , first week I am shown how to re 'enlist' my core muscles to help mitigate some lower back pain.  Over the span of the next two visits and adding more stretching and flexing, I felt a series of squish-click-pops and my lower lumbar pain went from a 9 to a 2.  And has stayed there.

So suffice to say I am now hooked on PT and have immense and complex feelings of gratitude for my PT enabling me to better myself.

But... Now that I am improving, I have to go back and deal with the mountain of stuff that was displaced by my severe recent pain.  Like taking the pin out of a seperated-ing (cohabiting coparents due to COVID and kids and finances) marriage.

1001,physiotherapy,"Hey guys

I'm 1 year into my career as an MSK physio and I find myself struggling lately.

I joined a private practice after graduating from university. It's a small but good team of 5 physios. I made my way through my first year with lots of learning. I felt I was finally getting good at my job, but the last month just seemed to absolutely crush me.

I had a lot of new clients in the last month who do not rebook or return for their follow-up appointments. Granted, a few of these patients presented with very simple issues like minor muscle tightness/soreness that did not need any long term care. However, there are many other of my patients who do not return after 1-2 visits when their conditions clearly need continued treatments to improve. I don't want to assume anything, but I suspect that most of their pain/symptoms are probably not 100% better given the way they presented to the clinic.

As part of our policy, we recall each patient that cancels or doesn't rebook out of courtesy. Out of the patients I managed to contact, some of them report that their pain was a bit better, but not much. Others say that the treatment hasn't had much of an effect. The final nail in the coffin is when i received an email from a client this morning saying that he/she decided not to return to physiotherapy because it flared up his/her symptoms.

I am in absolute disarray right now because my confidence in my own skills are in pieces. I don't know whether it's because I've become complacent (I don't think I have, but who am I to judge myself), or if it's a series of coincidences. I don't even know where to start to re-evaluate myself right now. It seems that in the past year, I was able to help most of my clients to get better within the first 2 sessions, and they return either for self-management/home exercise strategies, or to have their other pains/conditions looked at. But right now, I'm losing patients left and right and I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong.

What do you think about the lecturers and resources at University of Queensland? All physiotherapy lectures are currently online with some pracs at uni due to COVID? What do you think about the qualities of the online courses? Is it difficult to understand? As an international student, I possibly can’t attend the pracs at uni due to COVID as I can’t enter Australia at the moment. However, learning physiotherapy requires lots of hands-on experience which I really worry that online lectures possibly can't provide.

I heard UQ can possibly help the international students to apply for travel exemption right before the placement around next year in July to enter Australia. Do you know any international students facing similar problems and how they cope with it? 

I heard that the fail rates of courses and placement are relatively high in Australia, is it true? If I fail the course or placement, will I have a second chance to retake it or do I need to defer for one year?

Actually, I've also got an offer to study master of physiotherapy from Keele University in UK but the ranking seems to be lower than that of UQ.

3 years ago, I jumped off of a rock, wasn't that high, but lo and behold, being over 40 and possibly not Superman, I damaged both knees.  I did eventually get an MRI, and they confirmed that I had chondrosis/fissures in my cartilage in weight bearing areas.  Pre-arthritis is what the sports physio called it.  I was unlucky, I guess.  I did have a good 1.5 years of pretty intense pain and general tightness, and a little bit of patello-femoral syndrome, but that's slowly gone down.  Ligments all seemed to check out with physios.

Over the course of 2 years, I went to several physios, and they all went pretty hard with the idea of targeted exercises.  Bands.  Squats.  Leg lifts.  Though, the last physio simply said ""don't run"", and recommended getting Synvisc One injections, so I could tolerate exercise, which is my biggest issue.  I can't realistically rehab my knees, if I can only sleep 2 hours a night for weeks on end.

I have recently begun cycling VERY carefully, using an e-bike, so I could pedal off and on, and add some strengthening that way.  I can't even carry more than possibly 30 pounds, especially upstairs.

Should I try physio again?  Injections?  Just wait and see?  My knees ARE better than 3 years ago, I can walk/hike for hours, but I can't help but feel that this is too slow, and I'm pretty limited.  I don't expect to run ever again, I'm just trying to be realistic, and may shoot for being able to cycle and carry laundry up and down the stairs :)

On a personal note, every time I go to physios, I find they want to ""test my abilities"" and range, and manuipulate, etc, which invariably hurts me for days afterward.  I find it kills my self-esteem, as they tend to be bewildered that I ""can't do this"" or that, and that I ""should"" be able to.  One even said ""you just need to gain more confidence in moving your body"".

I have bachelor's degree in physiotherapy. But I have done many courses, read many books, follow research, etc. I have been in this line of work for 15 years. I work privately. 

I wanted to finish some Master's degree abroad, in UK with distant learning to be more specific, but that idea died today. Yes Master's is expensive, it takes time, and I was willing to go that route. But something happened and I do not see the value in that anymore like I used to. I wanted it because of academic title, CV, and when I organize courses so people would respect me more. 

But what popped that bubble is that my work will not change at all, and since I am fully formed clinician I really doubt I would learn something new there that I do not already know or could not learn by myself. I am not taking here in a count writing systematic reviews and being good at academic tasks. I speak 100% practice wise.

1066,physiotherapy,"I have a master degree in physiotherapy, I have 2 years working experience, during university studies I was practicing at a lot of different clinics. I finished my bachelor studies at a well known university in Prague. Now I am based in the capital of Slovakia - Bratislava and I wonder how low physiotherapists get paid here. It is usually around 5 to 6,5eur per hour (making it 800-1100eur per month) and it is hard to compete on this market since the clinica always find someone who does not mind and work for that money.

I have already succeeded at 2 interviews where I got offered almost double the usualy salary in the 1st one and a double the usual salary at the second one. First one is part time and I am currently employed here and the 2nd one was full time but I did not really like the working environment so I rejected this offer. 

Apart from these 2 offers, I was struggling to find anything else paid above 5eur per hour as the reason  always was that clinics can not afford to pay this amount of money to their physiotherapists. The clinics were always happy to hire me but they seemed quite frustrated that they can not pay me more than the mentioned 5eur/hour.

Do you think there's any way to get from the clinics that say they can not afford to pay physios more than 5eur/hour to actually make it? Prices of these clinkcs for 1 hour of physiotherapy varies from 30eur to 50eur.

Essentially, I was due to assess and administer treatment of a patient with tuberculosis, for the first time. The patient was in an isolation room with full PPE precautions required. 

Prior to visiting the patient and with my assessment and treatment plan prepared, I asked if I required supervision with this patient. There were many attachments that I'd need to disconnect to mobilise patient that I was encountering in practice for the first time. Similarly, I also wanted to ensure I was following correct infection control procedures. 

At the time, my supervisor said I didn't require supervision with the patient. So, I visited the patient independently and with the assistance of the nurse donned PPE and administered treatment. I had to figure out the attachments myself, and luckily it was not too complex. However, I felt somewhat uncomfortable treating in this context without supervision.

A few hours after treating the patient, I was called into my supervisors office and interrogated. Basically asked why I was unsupervised when treating patient. When I told him I asked a nurse for assistance he asked me for specific information on which nurse it was.

I found the entire situation confusing and stressful, considering he confirmed that it was fine in the first instance after I specifically asked. And that none of the other clinicians, who I actually handover to immediately prior to seeing the patient deemed that I should be supervised.

1119,physiotherapy,"After an exchange that got pretty nasty with a user who claimed he wasn't diagnosing a patient and yet another one this morning who even came up with 4 possible diagnoses we want to clarify what we understand by the term.

As soon as a poster gives an answer like

* It could be a torn &lt;whatever&gt; but ask your physio
* It is a tight &lt;whatever&gt;
* You probably have a damaged &lt;whatever&gt;
* I suspect it to be &lt;whatever&gt;
* You have &lt;whatever&gt; but it could also be &lt;whatever&gt;
* Tell your physio to look at your &lt;whatever&gt; because it could be &lt;whatever&gt;

 **you are diagnosing.**

There are more examples but these are the ones that pop up a couple times a week. Most of you won't see them because they're gone ASAP.

There are a couple reasons why we are so vehemently against it. It is not only because it is highly unethical to diagnose a patient without seeing him/her in real life. A second, similarly important reason is that once you have put something in someone's head it is pretty much impossible to get it out again. How would you like it when your patient would tell you ""Yeah, you could be right but these guys on reddit told me it was &lt;whatever&gt;"". 

And then there is the reason, albeit of less importance IMHO, that we al have worked hard to get our degrees and why should we offer advice for free?

Ofcourse a colleague could be wrong and sometimes a second opinion can be helpful. In our opion the downsides are more important.

Posters who proffer diagnoses and/or advice in a vague way get way with a slap on the wrist and their post is removed. More obvious ""offenders"" get a 30 day ban. Recidivists get a permanent ban. 

Obviously not-so-serious remarks like

* your chacra is out of line
* you dislodged your aura
* stop wearing red T-shirts
* have you looked at the color of your morning pipi

will not be sanctioned. Allthough, erm, some patients may even take these serious.

All that being said, Reddit has changed the rules about giving medical advice some time ago. It is now not generally forbidden to do so and moderators can define their own rules. We hope we have been able to clarify a frew things as to why we won't have it on this sub.

1121,physiotherapy,"I understand i might be breaking a rule of this subreddit. Im sorry but I’m desperate. If you could dm that would work.

Hello everyone , i come here today because after three physical therapy sessions i feel as though my physical therapist may not know exactly what he is talking about or is not taking me seriously. Additionally, i am a bit desperate.

Six years ago i rolled my ankle when i stepped into a hole on the field while at practice. I couldn’t walk for two days without pain and the front of my ankle was swollen. I was 17 at the time and had been lifting weights in bodybuilding fashion for a few years. Maybe two months afterward i noticed the calf on the injured ankle had atrophied significantly like ALOT and i was no longer getting pumps in that calf as opposed to my other calf muscle which functions normally and was a great deal larger. I figured it would return to normal on its own eventually and i had other life events sidetrack my life in the gym to the point where i stopped working out completely.

I am now 23 and upon my return to the gym over a year ago i still cannot feel the calf muscle on that leg and it remains smaller than my other calf. I don’t believe it is not a mind-muscle thing because i do not even feel a stretch in the left calf muscle when i stand on ledge while i do feel it in my right calf and I’ve tried doing single leg calf exercises. I also notice some overdevelopment on the outside of my calf while the main muscle that forms the bulk of it remains unresponsive no matter what. I can still flex the calf on the injured side but i do not get the tight cramping feeling i would get prior to my injury.

I went to see an orthopedic as i thought i might have a dislocated ankle and he took some x rays but found nothing wrong. My insurance declined to pay for a MRI.

Additionally my injured ankle pops a lot and in a more forceful manner than my other ankle and is quite loud. My physical therapist who I’ve been seeing for two weeks gave me some daily home exercises and a band such as dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion. 

When i got for my visits he has me do some balancing exercises and calf raises and continually asks me if i feel the muscle but i do not.

Question:

Is it ethical/legal to take a picture of a client on the professionals phone? Said client was half dressed lying face down and wasn't asked for consent, it was done to show the client his back posture supposedly but this was never asked for or initiated . The therapist also showed the client similar photos of other clients on his phone talking about there personal injury. This was not done in a professional manner and seemed like they were mocking the other clients of how bad their posture was and laughing etc. This made me extremely uncomfortable.

(first of all, i hope this is the right thread)

I've just received my Bachelor's in Physiotherapy in India and I aim to complete my Masters degree (in neurologic conditions) abroad. Most preferably in Australia, NZ or in the UK/around Europe. Of course I know that being an international student will cause a HUUGE dent in my wallet- but I wanted to study and complete my masters somewhere I can settle down; and for me it's either of the two. 

I've done most of my research on a good, well-reputed college, but I am still unsure of how the course goes in each country; and for that I'd need your help!

For universities in the UK, most of them need an experience of 1-2 years and I honestly couldn't find a course that didn't need it. If you have any in mind do let me know! But for now, UK is my last option.

&amp;#x200B;

In Australia and NZ (gosh, i know it's going to be super expensive), I found UTS and AUT quite interesting.... however, I also noticed that neither offer neurology focused courses. I just need a glimpse of how the degree is carried out, so if anyone has a basic idea... please do let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I am to become a neuro-physiotherapist... and if you'd help me move on from carrying my bpt degree to a masters in the same field... i'd be really grateful.

Any other routes are also appreciated, I'll take all the help I can get!

1146,physiotherapy,"Hi there,

4th year undergraduate in Singapore and I'm currently in placement. There's this new school policy for allied health students in placements which says that for students who fail 2 consecutive placements, the student will be asked to drop out of the course (that is to ""maintain the standards of \[the university's\] graduates""). Unfortunately I'm stuck at this choice point now and thinking whether I should  appeal to the examiners' board to repeat my MSK placement a 3rd time or to just drop out. 

In the first MSK placement I didn't start it with the right headspace - I didn't think I had good foundations because I didn't do well at all for the past 3 years which have been a struggle. I scraped through my practical exams as I have performance anxiety, and I'm currently seeing a counsellor to manage it. Staying back till late to plan for the following day's cases also took a toll on my physical and mental health. Couple that with poor confidence and low self-esteem, when I was unable to perform during my cases I just spiralled. I cried 4 times in front of my work mentor for 4 weeks and was miserable and tardy in general.

I was more in control and could manage my mental health better in the 2nd placement, so that was where my difficulties with the clinical skills were more apparent. Because I was caught up with wanting to do things right rather than safe, I tend to zoom in on what I want to observe and I fail to widen the lens and see what's around me. For instance, I would usually stand at a distance to observe my patient's gait, but you should at least be at a standby assistance level if the patient's gait is unstable.

Another reason is that I have difficulty modifying my assessments and treatments to my patients' needs on the fly. I find that difficult to plan for or predict, and the possibilities can be endless. Many times I had to scrap my plans for my review knee patients as they would present with acute flare-ups, or find that their main concern is now their back pain.

I have been asking my closer friends for their perspectives and most of them agree that I should toughen it out and complete the degree. My fourth year is only less than 9 months. However I found that the past 3 years have been a struggle - I couldn't find anything which I really excelled in (anatomy was REALLY challenging because I coudn't memorise well), I didn't really ""enjoy"" what I learned and my GPA is less than a 3. The main reason I joined physiotherapy was because I wanted a career that could impact the lives of others meaningfully. But it is also true that I can also do the same in other professions.

I  just feel that things would only go uphill from here should I be successful in my appeal- I am behind my peers 3 months, would be juggling with 2 thesis (1 group and 1 4.5k individual)  papers, and I must not fail my remaining 3 placements (MSK is my 2nd of 5 placements). At this rate I'm not sure if I can graduate with my peers on time; I will know more once the head of programme emails me regarding the next actions to take. My friend says I should just tackle things one at a time, but it's demoralising to know that even though I have put my best foot in it wasn't enough for me to make it through and I'm just tired. If I do decide to drop out, I do have backup plans to venture into F&amp;B, which is something that excites me.

I also could be very wrong with some of my information so please correct me 

From what I have heard: 
Private clinic contracter - starts with 50/50 split for new grads - if busy can make 100k+ a year. Average salary in a busy clinic working 35 hours a week - 110k? - you do not get paid leave or vacation as you are not considered ""an employee"" of the clinic. I am unsure if you get benefits from the clinic as well


Private clinic hourly - Starts 35 - 40hr. Can get up to 45/hr - you get paid if you see 5 patients or 15 patients in a day. You also get paid time off, vacation and benefits as you are an employee of the clinic and not considered a contracter. 

Working in hospital - Starting 34 - 37/hr depending on province. Can get up to 44 - 48/hr depending on time and experience. Great benefits, time off, vacation, pension etc. Can take a while to get above 40+/hr compared to working in a private clinic.

Right now I'm in my last year of Bachelor's degree in physiotherapy. I'm planning on also finishing Master's degree right after my bachelor's. 

During these three years of Bachelor's degree i finished a number of courses like dry needling, Cyriax A + B, sports massage, myofascial relaxation etc. Also I went for three weeks to work in nursing home in Portugal during high school because of Erasmus.

Right now, I'm volunteering as a physio in a professional football club in 2nd league for about 9 months now. 

My English is at C1-C2 level, and I'm about to start learning German from A1. So, you can see I'm investing heavily in myself and I plan to continue doing during Master's degree.

Now in Croatia to obtain our license we need to do a year of internship which is really hard to get because there are very few openings. Like some people wait over two years to get it.

But you can do a internship outside in Europe if a clinic or some institution is willing to take you. I plan on finding some place outside of Croatia for that after my master's.

A patient with a self limiting problem like a ""tennis elbow"" gets bored with his first physio because after a few weeks of treatment nothing much happens. He changes physios and after a month or so, again, not much improvement. He changes again and gets angry because of the ""incompetent"" therapists. Again, after a month or so, he sees a little improvement but not much. And again, here comes the next physio. We're about 6-7 months into treatment and things are improving a little. Maybe of natural causes, maybe it's the treatment. The patient gets bored again and, yes, here we go again, therapist number 6 enters the stage.  

Now, after nearly a year either all the preliminary work of all the previous physios bear fruit (or Mother Nature kicks in) and tataaa, improvement! Healing!

And who did it? Yes, obviously the Last Physio. 

This has some interesting consequences

1. The Last Physio could have done to that patient whatever he wanted, he would have improved anyway (as long as he did no harm). But the therapist and the patient now both believe this treatment is *The Treatment* for tenniselbow. The referring doctor may believe the same. OMG

2. The Last Physio gets a big ego boost. Because of that he will behave in a more confident way and this has a big positive influence on his patients. Super placebo!

Dear Mr Xxxxxxx,
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my referral. Michael has been attending my clinic recently for management of ongoing Left shoulder/CSP pain and tension. Following your most recent injection therapy and Michael’s continual strengthening the lateral shoulder and Upper trap/ Sub-deltoid bursa pain have resolved significantly. Michael has however developed non mechanical pain in the chest wall. Upon assessment this pain is quite consistent in nature but diffuse in anatomical location. On palpation the pain appears to be mostly presenting around the Subclavius muscle and into the proximal insertion of the anterior scalene into the first rib in the subclavian groove and the origin of the SCM (medial portion of the clavicle). To date we have worked on soft tissue release of the subclavian/SCM/anterior and middle scalene and have continued to improve Deep Neck Flexor strength and general R/C &amp; scapula-humeral stability. The pectoral muscles do not appear to be indicated upon assessment and Michael has continued to maintain full active/passive ROM in the left shoulder with ongoing improvement in strength/stability.
 
Michael’s pain however is not improving to any great extent with manual/exercise therapy and continues to be quite irritable at night. Other than the consistency of the pain and the non-mechanical nature of the symptoms there are no red flags of note with no reported aggravating factors or peripheral referral to the shoulder or hand.
 
I would very much appreciate your expert opinion on Michael’s most recent symptoms and your assessment of the neural structures such as the accessory nerve to examine if this may be responsible for the continual discomfort that Michael is experiencing. If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me at any stage.

So I can’t really remember why and how, probably because I grew so much during these last years my inside of the hamstring hurts. It used to hurt on both right and left, but now only left hurts.

TL;DR: Been dicked around by medical practitioners regarding my wife's muscle/body imbalances that are causing upper back, shoulder, and hip pain from a long sedentary lifestyle. Looking for a strategy to better communicate with them relevant information to actually get a diagnosis/treatment plan.

Hello First and foremost I am not looking for medical advice. I am looking for advice on how to find and communicate with a physiotherapist so they can give in person medical advice. A certain approach, keywords or something because all they seem to want to do is drag out the appointments and not even talk about the issue.

My wife and I are 28 and live in Canada, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. She is 5’ 1” at 120lbs.

This all started when she got stress fractures in both her shins from doing a few kickboxing classes, she went to her GP and all they told her is to do low impact for a month and didn't recommend us to a physio. A month later they weren't any better so we went again and pretty much got the same response as last time just saying ""it takes longer with some people"". We decided to go to a Physio without a recommendation and the first one we went to just did acupuncture and ultrasound to ""speed healing"". When we asked for an exercise prescription they just kind of dodged it several times.

Frustrated we tried another place where the physio gave her an exercise prescription and briefly inspected her saying she was tight in places that she shouldn't be and when asked if there was a hip imbalance he said yes but apparently “you are just born that way there is nothing you can do” which we know for a fact she wasn’t born that way, regardless the next step for the physio was to have my wife’s feet and gait measured and those graphs were all kinds of up and down with the worst being her right foot arch is collapsed which again we were told “there is no way to fix that but orthotics can help”, so to deal with this we got the custom orthotics but also began to do some research on our own.

This research lead us to some exercises for strengthening the muscles in the foot arch and I can confirm that it has been fixing the “unfixable” arch in her foot in addition to finding out that my wife has “Anterior Pelvic Tilt” which was putting extra strain on her shins making them heal really slow or not at all. We managed to fix  it after about 2 months of doing exercises which again we found online but we knew there was more wrong with her posture and alignment so we tried pushing for an x-ray to maybe see and confirm if there would be a supposed leg length discrepancy or if it is just posture, to which we got a response of “That’s too much radiation to put you through for this”.

Again frustrated with what we were being told and not really given any proper diagnosis we tried 2 other physios that continued the trend of not really paying attention to what we were saying, coming up with half assed exercises that they point us to a video with and don’t even help her get the form right which she can’t even get right because of her imbalances.

Finally we decided to try a chiropractor and they actually bothered to measure her tilt, showing it to be a few degrees tilted at the hips and shoulders and managed to get her some temporary relief in her back and shoulders, but again that is only temporary.

From our own research at this point (Again not from a practitioner of any kind) we pieced together that she may have “Knee Valgus” on her right leg as it bends inward, “Lateral Pelvic Tilt” with her left hip tilted higher than her right, and a “Rotated Pelvis” with her left side more forward than her right which is causing all sorts of pain in her hips, groin, upper back, and most importantly underneath her shoulder blades leading her to having poor quality of life, feelings of despair and panic attacks as no one seems to be able to help her.

My overall impression is that either these people don't know what they are doing or just trying to turn my wife into a forever customer by just applying a ""bandaid"" on the issue and not addressing the underlying cause, however my hope is that I just am not saying the magic words that properly describe the issue and get them to actually understand what I am asking of them.

I assumed that it was supposed to work like this: 

The GP hears your issue, recommends you to a physiotherapist, the physiotherapist gets your relevant medical history and does a physical examination, measures your range, checks for imbalances, maybe gets an x-ray to confirm the exact degrees of tilt, displacement or if there was an actual discrepancy with leg length. After that a treatment plan is made to strengthen and/or stretch muscles to slowly get things back in line with hands on guidance to do the exercises properly and with good form even if it requires recommending to a personal trainer with a reschedule appointment every few weeks to check progress and readjust the exercise program, but to be honest I don’t know I’m just a grocery clerk and this is my assumption.

At this point all we are doing is scouring articles and youtube for exercises that can strengthen the weak muscles on one side and relax the tight muscles on another but we are nowhere near medically knowledgeable and it’s just panicked trial and error and we are really desperate. 

Conclusion:

Really sorry for the long winded post I didn’t know what information would be relevant so i just put the whole story here, I just want to know if this is at all normal and hoping that there is just specific terms or way I need to approach a physiotherapist to get some proper treatment, it has been ruining my wife’s life she can’t be active without any pain and at this age that’s a tragedy. My wife has not had any broken bones or serious injuries that could have caused these things to be unfixable, we believe that it is from years of a sedentary lifestyle since a child to young adult crossing her legs a lot and leaning to one side and over time for hours at a time at home/work and it just really screwed her postural balance, but this should be theoretically possible to fix fairly easily just with a lot of time and dedication of doing the right exercises and not encouraging bad posture and sedentary life.",Advice On How To Better Communicate With A Physiotherapist (Not Medical Advice)

I want to make sure I can weightlift successfully for many, many years (the rest of my life if possible: I'm 21 now) to come. I enjoy it, it improves my mental health, and has many other benefits. 

I am also acutely aware of the risks involved with weightlifting - namely, connective tissue injuries and wear-&amp;-tear. I want to avoid these as much as possible. 

Since I'm barely a month into weightlifting (though I did have a 4 month period when I was 17 where I did it, which ended in right wrist tendonitis), I want to set good habits now. For now, I'm struggling with **potential** areas of injury - namely, my unstable shoulder, my left knee (with twinges at the patellar tendon), my left elbow (a result, I think, of my unstable shoulder and weak left wrist), and finally my right wrist, which has been unstable and weak since my injury.

Right now, I'm mainly worried about how to approach the first few months of training, which are characterised by large increases in strength, muscle and stress/load on the tendons (while I know that tendons in particular are slow to adapt to greater loads)

1298,physiotherapy,"Hey all

Curious to hear peoples thoughts on the matter, as I often hear conflicting things, it's either:

* Community isn't interesting, too generalist, and in case I was told: ""community is where physio's go to die"". I've been told by community trusts that they often struggle to fill physio vacancies due to the lack of demand

or

* Community is great, offers flexibility, insight into patients lives, a better ability to build therapeutic relationships, and generalist (but in a positive light)

I'm leaning towards the latter. While I have good communication skills, I'm somewhat introverted, so my ward and busy outpatient experiences have been very tiring. Seeing less patients, and having breaks between patients sounds like my cup of tea.

Arguably, I could be missing out on the development that comes with a rotation or another specialty, but this final year of study during COVID has been a ball ache, just want to settle into a job I enjoy and move out, so the idea of going straight into a community position appeals to me.

I’m an American looking to do a MSc in the UK! While I’m not planning on attending for about 2 years to continue to save money, I may need to take a small student loan out (less then $10,000 at most). Apparently Federal Student loans here in America can only be used towards foreign programs that do not involved a heavy placement curriculum (can’t be more than 25% of the credits). 

I know physiotherapy programs do involve some placements, but how much placement is it? 

I have reached out to some of the schools international advisors for help, but I haven’t been contacted quite yet. 

Would it be better to apply for a private loan instead, or attend a less prestigious/connected university that I can pay without loans?

Canadian postgrad student here, recently received offers into the Masters of  Physiotherapy programs at University of Sydney and University of Queensland. I’ve researched a bit about  the schools/city but would like some more insight on the physiotherapy  programs offered by these schools specifically. I have a BKin background so hopefully that helps with keeping up with the material as I've heard for the postgrad program it's quite intensive right off the bat. 

The two big considerations I've boiled it down to so far are overall quality of the program (student satisfaction, placement opportunities etc) and living in Sydney vs. Brisbane. It’s been tough trying  to decide between the two, and I feel a bit pressured to decide soon  with the rolling admissions and all. I've only got 2 weeks to accept UQ's offer and begin online learning this November. For Usyd, there's a possibility it will be in class learning for the February 2022 intake.

1393,physiotherapy,"Hi All,

So recently I quit my degree in my final year. I had 3x5 week placements left to complete to get my degree, however due to compounding anxiety issues (avoidance, panic episodes etc.) that made progression and any level of pt care impossible, I decided to withdraw from my course. The issues affected me significantly through my 3rd year and I missed about 90% of my main practicals because of it, but somehow I managed to pass my practical exams and never failed anything. 

Consequently, I lack many of the requisite skills to pass placements, particularly in the neuro and acute care settings and my condition seems to be vastly exacerbated by the hospital setting (sensory overload etc).

In hindsight, I probably should have communicated these issues to the clinical supervisor prior to undertaking placement, but I foolishly thought I could get by. I also was concerned about the overall impact of disclosing this information to them.

Since withdrawing things have improved alot. I'm working full-time in an unrelated area and overall wellbeing has improved. Whilst I still have mild anxiety, it is not at the crisis level it was during uni. However, the job is not a career and the shroud of having been so close to finishing my degree looms. 

I'm unsure if I can even finish my degree at this point, or if being a physio is the right career choice for me personally.

I have a weightlifting background so I’m more experienced in prescribing exercise for healthy people, but have found it slightly challenging at uni to complete case studies where I need to give exercises to patients who have had a total knee replacement for example.

I’ve managed okay, however every now and then get stuck because it’s always difficult for me to image what case study patients can do and can’t do.

1428,physiotherapy,"I'm a non-US student and right now my class is under going discussions about multidisciplinary team, and I'm quite confused about the PT's scope of practice, compared to other healthcare professionals. Will those with experience be able to help out with my understanding about the different roles? 

I just found out that OTs can also teach breathing techniques and energy conservation techniques. I was wondering for a pulmonary patient when doing co-treating, who would be the one ""in-charge"" of educating and following up on this? I understand that PT works with the patient's aerobic capacity, but I understand that OT needs to address this if it's interfering with their ADL training. 

Dietitians does the 99% of weight management, but it's not unheard of for PT to also address nutrition issues. For example, I read papers that states it is also important for PT to educate nutrition and diet, especially if it's impacting their condition (e.g. OA). However, everyone's being vague in saying ""education"". I don't think they meant for you to just say ""lose weight = healthier"", so I was thinking what type of education a PT can do that does not overlap with a dietitian's education  topics as well.

I just read a comment here that PT can use CBT in their treatment. But isn't CBT only administered by a trained psychologist? How can PT conduct CBT on a patient? I understand motivational interviewing, but to the point of CBT? I do understand the benefits of doing CBT with the patient but isn't this creeping into the psychologist scope of practice?

Nursing does suction in airway management. I understand, but apparently PT also does suctioning. In a normal setting, if the patient needs to do suctioning, who would be in charge of it? Nurses or PT? I understand that it doesn't matter and everyone should help each other out, but because PTs usually have only 30 mins of consultation time, I assume Nurses have to be the main here, but Nurses are also handling different patient in a ward. So I wonder who will step in, in this scenario?

At the same time, PTs can also work in ICU. I saw in the US there are Respiratory Therapists, I was wondering whats the difference between the jobscope between the two. Based on research, I know both can be in a ?code blue team, and only RTs can be present in airway management during surgery, but aside from that, I have no other clue.

My friend is studying to be an Exercise Physiologist, which he said he can prescribe exercises. I only know that they are usually to administer CPETs like Bruce Protocols if the PTs are unable to, but apparently it seems that PTs also can't administer CPETs in a hospital setting? Can someone clarify? I'm actually really not sure what an Exercise Physiologist does, as I assume they are mostly research oriented...

Does TMJ management goes under Speech Therapist or PTs? Also, I understand that Speech Therapist trains the speech muscles only, but I've read they also do neck muscles as well as it also helps in swallowing. Same thing, to what extent does STs trains the muscles and which one falls under the PT?

Sorry, I understand that it's a lot and the health care system is very complex but I'm quite confused especially on what treatments I should be taking in consideration, especially doing viva exams. Thank you so much",PT scope of practice?

Hello;

I have been suffering from a strange problem for 10 years now. I have been in a lot of physiotherapists and osteopaths without much success, which may alleviate the symptoms momentarily but not in the long term. The thing is that the whole right side of my body is very stiff and this causes me a lot of discomfort in different places: first of all I have a lot of abdominal tension especially on the right side and this causes that when I take a deep breath I notice a blockage in that area (diaphragm) as well as pain in the neck (scalenes) on the same side. I also feel instability in the shoulder and hip on the right side. When I am very stiff I cannot release the tensions no matter how much I stretch the affected areas, but my body clicks all the bones in my body to release them, especially the hip, neck and shoulder. In addition to this my first rib is elevated compressing my brachial plexus so my right arm is often numb or crampy. I also have noticed that my right shoulder is lower than my left. There are times when I manage to be quite well by doing a lot of postural correction work, stretching and diaphragmatic breathing but the problems always return and the tension lasts for weeks. 

   
 

I would like to know if any of you have experienced something similar and if so, how you have been able to solve it. I am quite desperate to find a solution as I live with chronic pain and this wears me down physically and mentally.

However, physios are now on the UK’s shortage list, and believe they will be for a while due to the possible long turn effects of covid. 

Theoretically, how difficult would it be to get a work visa in the UK as a DPT from America? Would a specialization make it harder or easier? I know there is some slight education differences, particularly with the respiratory therapist. I’ve already read about becoming registered with the HCPC and CSP.",American DPT in the UK?
1487,physiotherapy,"Hello guys, I’ve been asked a few times in private about any update regarding the condition, and gathered myself up to do it at last.

&amp;#x200B;

Herewith the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/66okkx/how\_come\_i\_cant\_fully\_extend\_my\_legs\_how\_could\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/66okkx/how_come_i_cant_fully_extend_my_legs_how_could_it/)

&amp;#x200B;

It’s possible! I’ve no longer wooden legs and my flexibility has improved tenfold. So how did I manage to fix this?

&amp;#x200B;

It started over a year ago, when I took up muay thai classes. For starters, muay is thai boxing, a form of boxing that involves all limbs (I believe it’s also known as ”the 8-limbed Art” or something along those lines). I was looking for traditional boxing lessons but I had the opportunity to practice with a friend of mine who’d just begun coaching that discipline, and I went for it in spite of apprehensions I had. What were these, you may ask? Well following the initial object of the post, you could rightfully guess that the utter lack of flexibility in my lower body sapped any confidence I may have had regarding any physical activity that required a given amount of suppleness in the legs; so for a long time boxing was the only viable combat sport/martial art in my mind. Which is really a silly way to think now that I think of it! But as long as I believed that I was bound to stick with my condition, that only minor improvements were possible, it remained true, until fate gave me this occasion to see how my mindset would stand as I confronted it with reality.

&amp;#x200B;

So I must be thankful to my friend as well, who spurred me toward the right direction by affirming that it was all attainable and more within a given time.

&amp;#x200B;

Muay thai practice was thus the first step toward serious improvement as far as I’m concerned. What did the trick is that I had a goal to attain, a proper state to strive for, which encouraged me to implement the necessary steps in order to attain the required flexibility at each stage of my progression.

I had done yoga before for short periods of time, I can neither dismiss it or vouch for that as it wasn’t nearly long enough a practice to assess its efficiency rightfully; however over the same time period I can affirm that the progress in that regard was much faster, I could witness solid results after merely three months.

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless it was after about three months that I faced my first proper hindrance with regard to suppleness development in the legs, and that was hip flexor pain in my right leg. I couldn’t throw kicks anymore because of that, quite annoying as they’re obviously integral to the practice, so I had to see a specialist as advised by my trainer. it was quickly followed by a deadly lumbago, something that happened about every year or so for 4 years and that was getting increasingly concerning. I went to see an osteopath and from then on it all went uphill. What really kicked it all into high gear is that we now knew what was up, not only with my crooked legs but my back pain and everything that was going on with my posture really.

&amp;#x200B;

It appeared that due to a scoliosis that developed in my teenage years and hadn’t been addressed, my body adapted to it posture-wise but was starting to meet its limitations as far as this strategy’s concerned, resulting in localised complications such as the lumbago. Another important factor was my feet whose weight was distributed too much inward.

As a result of the diagnosis the osteopath indicated the specific movements that needed to be applied in order to get the body to a healthier, therefore suppler state. It’s likely that most if not al those areas should be targeted if you have the same impediment as I did:

\- Hip rotation

\- Back extension

\- Back rotation

\- Hamstring stretching (obviously)

\- Psoas stretching

\- Adductor stretching

&amp;#x200B;

Having that information, all that was needed was to share it with my coach who designed a specific program relative to these types of movement. I have a battery of them in case you’re interested, but the exercises themselves don’t matter as much as knowing what area to work upon and how. At any rate I HIGHLY recommend you to see a skilled specialist so that he or she gives a precise diagnosis as to what’s going on. While it sounds as sensible as it gets to most of you, I haven’t done it and it would’ve been so easier had I done it earlier. My other recommandation is to practice a physical activity that forces you to up your flexibility, so that it doesn’t become boring. Once an effective routine is found there’s nothing more dangerous than resting on your laurels, and there’s no doubt it works better as an incentive within the framework of an encompassing physical practice that hinges on steady progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I took care of the feet issue by seeing a chiropodist. That’s a real big deal because one’s whole posture rests upon his feet, and even though all the exercises are done correctly and regularly, the feet’s incorrect placement is ever going to hinder the process of getting the rest of the body back into a healthy and balanced. It may or may not be the case for you, which would be great, but that’s how it’s been for me and I’m wagering it’s likely to be same if the issue is excessively tight hip and leg muscles and chronic lower back pain. It’s directly related indeed. The solution for that after the chiropodist’s diagnosis was to practice specific exercises (the same I’d mentioned earlier) and to wear dedicated soles so the feet would return to a normal state after at least a few months’ wear. It’s been a year I’ve been wearing them and the improvement has been tremendous.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s how it is folks. For personal reasons I quit muay thai after 10 months, although it’s been a wonderful journey and I eventually wish to practise it again; I still do stretching exercises once every few days, with more or less intervals in between, which isn’t as much as I used to do for about the first 9 months since seeing the osteopath. I used to do it every day, especially in the beginning, and the reason for the decrease is that I finally broke free of that, the state I’ve reached as far as flexibility and lightness of movement are concerned is beyond what I had expected for the greater part of my life. I still try to push the boundaries once in a while but the goal has been attained, and I’ve moved on to other things now, and there’s no need to focus on this issue anymore. I’m willing to try yoga again one of these days; as for now, my primary physical activity is dancing which is something I wish to be good at someday, and that became infinitely much easier once I got my posture in check.

1491,physiotherapy,"I’m a relatively new business (self-employed is very common in the UK) so my client numbers are quite low especially starting during COVID times. Throughout I have experienced a large percentage of my clients cancelling last minute - I do have a 50% deposit system in place to protect myself but some people do not pay this and I can’t exactly force them to do so (I am cash based at the moment, no online booking as of yet). This is leaving me short, money and time-wise and is quite disheartening to say the least. Do any of you experience this? What do you do about it? Should I be worrying so much or just move on and focus on my regular clients? 

I do explain with every new client that comes that the first session is going to be a thorough assessment (subjective/objective, lifestyle, etc.) with rehab exercises demonstrated and prescribed towards the end, and that they may experience a slight spike in pain as we have been testing the joint/muscle/injury to try to find the root of the problem. It always seems to be after this first session, people book in again but a few days before their next appointment contact me saying “oh it feels fine now, I will let you know if I need anymore treatment...” I do also explain that we as physios dont have a magic touch, and coming once wont fix your problem, I put an emphasis that recovery will take some time but with the tight management and communication we can work together to resolve this. 

Maybe some people just expect a quick fix and dont want to pay for multiple sessions.",Does anyone else have quite a few cancellations?

1493,physiotherapy,"If you search Reddit or the wider internet for posts related to Osteopathy, you will come across a large number of comments and posts that describe Osteopathy as pseudoscientific quackery. 

In the UK at least, Osteopaths and Physiotherapists share ~70% of their curriculum and training. In many other countries (off the top of my head I can name Belgium and maybe Canada) you are required to train as a physiotherapist before you can become an Osteopath. I am currently studying Osteopathy, and I was excited and surprised when we were taught how to read blood reports, ECG results, and test the cranial nerves. I guess I thought I’d just be fixing bad backs. 
Yet I rarely see the same criticisms of Physiotherapy, so I started considering what differentiates these professions, and potential reasons why Osteopathy receives criticism. 

The main reason I arrived at was that Osteopaths don’t have treatment guidelines in the same way that Physiotherapists do. Two Osteopaths would likely have a different treatment plan for the same condition, whereas from my experience Physiotherapists will vary at lot less. 
This could be due to some Osteopaths (the minority, from my experience) following the teaching of A.T. Still and his model of medicine very closely. This usually involves an emphasis on techniques that have been shown to work with anecdotal evidence. Personally, I don’t have a problem with this as long as the patient is well informed and the practitioner isn’t claiming that Osteopathy is voodoo magic that can cure anything.

I’m echoing the perspective of /u/MedlifeCrisis (who runs a wonderful YouTube channel). 

I was curious on other perspectives on Osteopathic treatment, it’s public perception, and anything else you find relevant. This is super interesting to me, so thank you for any input!",Osteopathy Discussion
