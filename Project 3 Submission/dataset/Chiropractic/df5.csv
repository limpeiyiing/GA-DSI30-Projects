How hard is school? Is there ANY way to work at all or is it impossible? How many class and study hours should I expect a week? Do you have to be naturally gifted to be successful or just willing to study? How hard is it to actually get into schools? I’m thinking of going to school abroad (new zealand).

Chiropractic,"Went to chiropractor for shoulder pain... excellent reviews online.
First appointment was told I needed to come twice a week for six weeks, then after that once a week till I hit 28 appointments and then she’d do a reassessment.

Have had 8 visits now since April 30th.

First adjustment felt straighter and my lower back later. Basically she cracked my neck and rolled me around really roughly on my side. Following day feeling a full pain in lower back. 

Been going back as I keep thinking next time that pain I never had will get better. She said she would be more gentle and still doing same movements.

Now my eighth appointment on Saturday morning - told her how stiff I was at the previous appointment and this time I also go muscle pain in my neck. She said what o did the first day usually works when I do it once or twice on my other patients.

Today I’m not even able to sit. My lower back feels like it’s going to explode with pressure and I feel like  an i***t.. this lady has 20 years of experience but form her comments seems like she’s just been flying blind with the same moves on everyone?

Needless to say I’ve cancelled all my subsequent appointments and have booked to go and see my md about what it is she damaged there.

Just a word of warning for everyone out there .. if in doubt get out fast!!!",Feeling like a complete idiot
Chiropractic,"My daughter who is 8 and has Down syndrome has seemed to develop anxiety over maybe the past 2 Yrs tops and has somewhat stopped progressing. Kept seeing an add on Fb so decided to try it after seeing great reviews. They did 3 scans which I will post the picture of the scans below in the comments since I can’t post text and picture here. They are saying basically that her nervous system is in parasympathetic mode and with give or take 84 adjustments her nervous system will be completely back to normal where it will be able to function properly like it used to. She’s gone from fearless to scared of everything, picking her fingers raw daily and not progressing anymore in school and I would much rather do something like this IF it’s legit over a dr who may just give her anxiety meds but I don’t see how they would address her progressing issues and probably just blame it on her Down syndrome. She’s always progressed faster than normal and just slowly stopped so this would be a great thing if they seem legit. As the picture shows they did an HRV test, a rolling thermal NCM test and a static EMG amplitude test. She did wiggle from it tickling her on the part where it shows the extremely long red line at her side and couple lines by her should so that did affect it some but she did not move on the neck part. They have a pay by appt plan but said they offer payment plans which one is prepayment, one is down payment with monthly after and the other is monthly. They of course say it’s to make it more affordable and does take some of the price down so it does look more appealing than $50 per visit 3x a wk with a scan every 12 visits which would be $100.  They also state that in the beginning symptoms may worsen as the body “detoxes” and gets rid of the anxieties etc that affect the patient but that the scans will be able to show that there’s improvement and that it’s supposedly, matter of fact I will post a picture of that page below too. I’m looking at potentially just paying monthly IF you guys think this chiro isn’t a scam just trying to get money since for all I know their reviews could be paid for ect. Especially since I saw where chiropractors asking for prepayments or plans may need to be avoided. I’m not looking for medical advice just advice on the technology and the chiropractor’s statements and whatnot since you guys have the experience with this sector that I don’t so I’d hate to waste money just being led on but will gladly spend it if it will help her. Thank you to anybody that can help me. I also have read that the rolling thermography technique isn’t valid or invalid which was my 2nd Google search thread that brought me here so I haven’t made it to what would be my 3rd search of the static emg validity yet. I truly do appreciate any and all help!",Trying to find out if this chiropractor seems legit or not... found this subreddit on a Google search and need any advice I can get please.

Chiropractic,"So $&amp;@! Sick and tired of seeing patients led to believe worst case scenario, usually maximizing profit for the provider. Usually, guidelines completely obliterated. 

Chiro’s do it: whether it’s the solemn look up from the xxray screen to say”…I’m so sorry…you have….spinal decay. Third stage. I’m so sorry. We must get to work reversing this. I guess I can do it for $4,797.25, if you pay in advance. Go pawn your car title and we’ll get started” or the “your glutes aren’t firing and your abs are weak. Let’s do some extensions, it’s a disk issue.”

MD’s do it. The acute low back pain patient after working in the garden bent over all day.  Trip to ortho “nothing we can but a dose pack and pain meds. Urgent MRI, we’ll squeeze you into the MRI we own.  Oh, looky there, you’re 47, have decreased disc space, facet joint wearing and, and, OH MY GOD! A disc bulge! And a herniation!   You have ARTHRITIS! You have DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE!  We’ll schedule you with pain management (in our office of course) and our surgeon.  Just don’t do anything, you could be crippled.”

PCP’s do it:  “Oh, you went for a walk longer than you have in 20 years, now you have pain in the low back and lateral thigh?  It’s sciatica. We’ll give you a dose pack and refer to a surgeon”. “

PT’s do it. “Oh, you’re a 47 year old office worker with low back pain when you lean back? Must be a disk. Let’s do some extension exercises past your pain tolerance for a half hour. Your glutes aren’t firing. Your abs aren’t strong.”

I don’t believe any of these scenarios, based on true recent cases I’ve seen, are being managed in a patient centered, evidence based manor.

Chiropractic,"My mother is a chiropractor and has her own clinic, growing up I wanted to follow her path in also becoming a chiropractor because I thought it would be a steady and safe path for me to go into, and it is something I quite enjoy (just by observation). Now that I think about it, it was also a way for me to seek their approval and also build my pride. 

However, it is now that I got accepted into chiropractic school and started to prepare for it where I start to regret my decision. 

I have a sheltered mind where I don’t really think throughly on things and simple rely on others to make the decision for me, and now with this decision that I “made” for myself, I’m slowly eating the consequences. 

Now thinking about it, it was very naive of me to think getting a chiropractic degree is enough. I now realize that it’s more than that: my whole life would be under their control since most of my financials comes from them, meaning I don’t get much freedom, lack of a social life because I’d be spending time studying, and I would have to manage all of her patients, live up to her name (being referred as ___’s kid instead of building my own brand), and also eventually taking over the business (which involves a lot of logistics and entrepreneurship) and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that, or if I want to be forever under that.

I just graduated a week ago, and I haven’t started chiropractic school and I’m already regretting it, and I feel that it’s too late to backtrack since I’ve already gotten accepted to the school and my parents already are pouring so much money on me. But at the same time, I feel that the pressure and stress would not be good for my mental health to the point where I might actually become depress in school. 

But another thought is, what would I be doing with an undergrad health communications degree? I’m scared to quit now and have no other plans to go into because I have no idea what I like doing. Then I will be an absolute failure. 

Should I talk to my parents about my thought process when they have already invested so much money?  Or should I suck it up because this is the decision I made for myself?",[Long Vent] [Advice] I am starting to regret my decision to chiropractic school and want to quit before starting but it’s too late to backtrack
Chiropractic,"I've been in practice as an for a few years at my current clinic. My current employer requires me to give three months (he's personally requested 6 months in the past) notice in my contract or I forfeit my bonuses for whatever length of time I'm still there (probably only like 1.5-2k in this scenario). I just got a job offer in my hometown in a different state, but they need me by the end of July. So I'm effectively giving him about 6 weeks notice and I feel bad for putting him in a bind bc now he's going to have to work his butt off to see all of these patients until he finds another DC.

A little context here. Currently I make a good base salary of 72k plus a bonus structure (that I've tried to renegotiate with him) of $4 per patient visit. So I made about 90k last year. I tried to do a % of my billed collections, but he said that's too much extra work for him and his wife, so he shot it down the few times I proposed it. When we resigned terms of another three year contract he initially agreed to bump it up to $5 but stated a few months afterwards agreeing to these terms that I'd be getting too much of a raise and that I'd have to take a bump from the previous $3 to $4 per visit.

Fast forward to now and this clinic that is back in my hometown where I'd prefer to live (due to friends and family, my kids would also have cousins etc.) Is offering me a 100k salary and 25% of everything collected off of my billing after I reach that base salary. I'd be working alongside an FNP and would be the only DC in the office. My wife would also love to move back so I'm definitely taking the job based on the above info. I just got the offer this week but he's out of town on vacation. So I have to wait to tell him until Monday.

Basically I'm curious what most people here consider to be a long enough resignation period. I really don't see a way to not take this offer since I'm going to get a significant pay raise (calculated to be about a 40-50% pay raise) and will be living where I'd like to be. 

I have to do what's best for me and my family, and since he doesn't really want to change my pay by any significant measure (Not to mention supplying DME to any patient that has a met deductible or decent coverage for it... I feel dirty and unethical doing so since he requires me to give them to anyone that has any type of low back pain or ""uneven pelvis""). I feel guilty for it leaving him much time to find my replacement bc I do like him as a person and a boss.

Chiropractic,"Hey chiros. I recently had a strange nerve problem happening in the rhomboid muscle behind my right shoulder blade. I'd been to a chiropractor in the past for a slipped rib, which was fixed in just one visit, so I figure it was time to seek out help from a chiropractor in a new city I had moved to.  


I found this clinic just down the street from me. Before they would even adjust or look at my back, they insisted on x-rays. I had them done, was told I had a straight back and neck, and that I needed to sign up for a three month program with multiple adjustments per week. I caved. I thought I was doing the right thing for my health and my body.  


Long story short, after two weeks of adjustments, my back has progressively felt tenser, in more pain, and worse. Especially in other areas of my neck and back that had no problems before. They're also pushing these ""Max Living"" supplements and seminars on me (which after reading this subreddit has convinced me to cancel my membership). The office also feels like a cattle mill - you do these stretches and chair exercises - then the Chiro maybe adjusts you for two minutes tops as other members wait their turn in a number system. Posters on the walls talk about how chiropractors can replace your primary care doctors, and how members have been able to quit their prescription meds. The whole thing now feels like a scam, and I'm in more pain.  


I called their office today, and asked that I cancel my membership and receive a partial refund for services no longer desired. The desk clerk said I would be unable to cancel over the phone for ""legal reasons"" as the doctor would need to sit down with me in an office and explain my case to me. She said something about how it was bad for me to leave without knowing what work I needed to do. I told her it felt like that practice was a way to pressure me to continue, and I did not want to talk to a doctor. So their cancellation practices feel scammy too?

Chiropractic,"Disclaimer: This is not a question about a medical condition. This question is about the chiropractor in prospect. 

I went and saw this chiropractor over the weekend. On the internet, I saw that he had a complete clinic. However it seems that in recent years, that office has been ""taken away"" and he doesn't even accept insurance at this point despite his name being listed on the insurance company's website. This initial visit was a $100 charge and subsequent visits will be $50 each. When I visited him, his office was in this one building in the basement and he doesn't even have a sign on the door. His secretary provided me the wrong room number when she texted me after I called. There was a different chiropractic office in the building, so I was confused and almost left to go to his previous address.

He told me that he only works 3 days out of the week, one of those days being a Saturday. This is because he has cancer and is in stage 4 of chemotherapy, causing his body weight to be down. He seemed to do his job fine and I felt significantly improved upon the day afterwards.

Chiropractic,"Hello all,

I’m going to be graduating this summer and have some offers I need advice on. I’ve talked to my wife and father extensively about it but they aren’t in the profession so it’s a little harder to gauge for them.

Background: new father and want more kids in the next few years so that’s where my thoughts and priorities are. Also a new home owner.

My first offer is not bad. I get 25% collections with no health benefits and 10 days unpaid vacation. I work 3 nights a week until 7 to 6, 1 night a week until 8, and every other Saturday 8 to 1. This isn’t bad but limits my time at home and puts stress on my wife to take care of the kids a lot. I also may be able to become a part owner between 7 to 20 years (time frame is very fluid right now). 

My second offer is to associate for 3 years and become the owner. I would work 8 to 4, 4 days a week and no weekends. This is nice because it allows me to have more control over my work but I can see where this adds stress to my home life as well.

One of the biggest issues is the non compete clause. If I work with option 1, I’m stuck because my wife won’t want to move outside of the radius and my life timeline will be on counting on this doc to retire which could be a decade or more. It eliminates option 2 completely if I sign on. 

I am really, really unsure where to take my life right now. I want to do the absolute best for my wife and son and they, along with our stability as a family, is my top priority.

After my adjustment I get up and there is a greasy body print on the leather adjusting table. I was mortified and just said “thank you, see you next week!” and left. I know she cleans the tables after each patient and probably didn’t think anything of it….right? Does this happen to anyone else at their practice with patients or anyone have this happen as a patient? (I have really bad social anxiety and body/trauma/self esteem issues so I’m sure that is playing a part in all this.) Needless to say, I will not be slathering lotion on before my next appointment if I show my face in that office again.",Why am I so mortified?
Chiropractic,"I am interested in hearing practicing chiropractors describe their personal techniques.  Very few DCs practice only one technique and I am interested in seeing more technique conversations.  What do you like from what techniques and why?  How do you successfully mix them?

I'm not interested in conflict or judgement here so please keep it off this post.  I'm well aware of the limitations of technique studies, let's not make this a conversation about that. I'd really like to see some POSITIVE and INFORMED opinions on technique.",Your technique-opinions and observations.
Chiropractic,"Appointment 1: 
Chief concern: 34weeks pregnant moderate-severe upper left rib pain while working with my arms elevated all day, and severe rib pain that wakes me up at night. Some pelvic girdle pain, normal back pain from working.

Adjustments: electric massager lightly up and down spine, back crack, side lying hip twists, neck crack, and activator on rib/sternum 10x after finding tenderness on sternum. Told me the rib was “separated”. Told to come back asap in a few days.

————

Appointment 2: Came back a few days later as prescribed

Adjustments:
electric massager lightly up and down spine, Back crack (one audible pop), side lying hip twists (no cracks audible on pelvis, probably due to it being done a few days ago), neck crack, and massaged muscle near the rib/sternum where a muscle spasm was for a few minutes with CBD lotion. Didn’t use activator today. Told me to massage the area at home and come back if pain doesn’t fully subside in a week or so. Appointment less than 5 minutes.

I texted her after the appointment asking if it was a separated rib like mentioned last visit, or just muscle pain. 
“You did have a rib out for sure and I did adjust it from the back today, but when I palpated the front I didn't not feel it was an anterior rib issue l, I felt it was a muscle spasm... SO a combo of both! I want to see how today goes before I give you any additional recommendations, we have to see how your body responds.”

At this point I know I’m being a PITA patient

————


Appointment 3:
Pain in rib continued but didn’t have time to come in again. 

Came back a few weeks later for pelvic injury while getting out of shower, severe pain feeling like I separated the pelvis at the pubic bone. She interrupted me before I could tell her what all is going on and areas it hurt, she just said hop on I’ll check it out.

Adjustments: 
Electric massager lightly up and down spine, Back crack, side lying hip twists (loud cracks audible on left side pelvis that hurt a bunch, probably due to the injury), neck crack, pulled each leg to pop hip joints. Pulled me off the table and said give it a day to settle and “see you in a week” Waddled out in more pain than when I came in.

No relief around the pubic bone or any of the severe areas.

————-

Appointment 4:
My chiro is out sick so had someone covering for her. The new chiro was a young graduate that was shadowing at our last few visits. I’m excited to have a second opinion!
I asked her if she could evaluate my pelvis after my injury and that it hurts most on my pubic bone.

Adjustments:
She did all the same things the regular chiro did in the past, except nothing popped. She then evaluated my pelvis on the front and said I have SPD and the pelvis is locked up. She used the activator on my pubic bone from each side and warned me it was going to be tender, it hurt a TON when she did it but I was happy something was being done about it! She then massaged firmly under my belly (also hurt a ton) saying the muscle under the belly is attached to the pubic bone so loosening it will help. She said it will likely continue to hurt a bit after giving birth.

I asked if I should continue to have this done weekly and she said “well you are 39 weeks, so only if you haven’t given birth yet”. Which contradicts her saying it will continue to hurt after birth.

I made another appointment one week later. Should I continue going here??","My experience so far with pregnancy care, should I find a new chiro?"

Chiropractic,"Hello! Recently, I was wrestling my friend who is a year older than me as well as 20 pounds heavier, I am only 15. Whilst wrestling, he put me in a weird chokehold where he wasn’t choking my neck, but squeezing my ear and like side of my face together, it kind of hurt but he then proceeded to like throw me under him a little and I heard 3 cracks in my neck. After tapping, my neck didn’t feel severely injured but when I turned it I heard some crackling noises, now a day later it feels a little sore.

Chiropractic,"My c1 is misaligned and rotated almost 10 degrees.  I was afraid to ask my upper cervical chiropractor how serious he thought it was because I'm too preoccupied with trying to convince myself it could all just be in my head and didn't ask the right questions.  

The injury to my neck happened almost a year ago during rebound high csf pressure from a spontaneous csf leak that my doctor wouldn't take me seriously for and that went untreated.

Chiropractic,"Hey guys.. I’m 4 weeks/4 sessions into my chiropractor and prior to this week I felt like my life was changing with him! But now this week I am REALLY curved to the left… while he did free up part of my jaw on the right. Basically it’s like we got one part settled and it threw off everything else, and idk if this is part of the game with a long process or is this guy no good?  

I have battled stomach and weird muscle issues for the whole pandemic and after a truly depressing and scary 2021 with a million tests, medications and doctors, finally this new chiropractor last month took an X ray (the one thing I didn’t do! And I went to 3 chiropractors last year and none of them even mentioned it.) and we found my spine was super curved and I was so hunched and really needed some work. I had been sitting and scrolling the WHOLE pandemic and mixed with poor dental work, I really screwed up my jaw, posture, hips, everything. 

He said at least 10 weekly and then probably can go month to month. In the first few sessions it started freeing up parts I hadn’t even realized were messed up and my stomach issues and anxiety finally started to fade and I felt OKAY for the first time in over a year …. And then this week it was like the second he hit a certain spot I knew it was off and my anxiety came right back. He readjusted 2 days later and that nite I felt so sick and my head felt so heavy I couldn’t even lift it. The next morning I was okay, but I’m definitely completely misaligned. 

Any help, direction, advice, similar stories anything would be helpful. I have been going through this whole process blindly and watching my body change over and over and it’s terrifying and Google has nothing for me on this and neither do my friends",Worse before getting better?
Chiropractic,"Caught [this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj9954?fbclid=IwAR38stiAEvNhcbwiTrm2vDCqQoH7Z30wq6vKjP3qkcpUFiXk8gtXR6zJrgk) (SFW link that goes to Science Translational Medicine for the full paper) recently and I have A LOT of reading to do to fully understand it, but the gist of the paper is that neutrophil activation in acute inflammatory responses may protect against the development of chronic low back pain. Keep in mind, pain is biopsychosocial and there is a lot involved, however, this paper suggests an interesting ""bio"" link that could be a trigger that could help explain by 1 in 4 people suffer from ongoing pain. In my initial skim of the paper it looks like they're looking at it from an epigenetic (turning genes on/off) perspective, although I could even be wrong about that. Lots of big words, LOL. 

In rodents (and I think this pertains to humans), the acute pain duration was lengthened in the group taking anti-inflammatories. One of the prime tenets of current pain science is to control acute pain by any means necessary as early as possible, which makes some sense given that you can't have chronic pain without it being acute pain in the first place, but this study should give practitioners pause when it comes to the ANY part of ""any means necessary."" 

I think this dovetails somewhat nicely with the recent discussion on ""Will DC's ever go under the AMA"" (which I took to mean will DC's ever have a plenary medical license?) and presents an interesting argument for why a profession's ""philosophy"" is probably more important that certainly Reddit chiros give it. The medical standard for at least NMSK pain ALWAYS involves NSAIDs for all guidelines as first-line treatment. As non-prescribing providers, that's a guideline we can't easily follow and I wonder to what effect that has created temporary, short-term discomfort that has actually greatly benefited patients who weren't already self-administering NSAIDs and maybe there is a good reason for chiropractors to remain a non-drug profession. I'll be curious to watch this research extend into human trials and then see how many decades it takes for medical practitioners to adopt it if it pans out. (sorry, can't NOT be cynical when it comes to these sorts of things). 

I've driven my wife crazy for years because I stubbornly refuse to take NSAIDs myself, saying silly things like, ""My shoulder hurts because I hurt it, not because I am low on NSAIDs"" which drives her nuts. But, for real, in the past 30 years I've used Ibuprofen 800mg for about 1 week when I fractured some ribs and that is the extent of my NSAID use as an adult. I've never thought that it makes sense to suppress inflammation unless it's really out of control and I feel a little bit validated in that, even if it's just one rat study. But on a more serious note, I wonder how many chiropractic patients have benefitted from not immediately being being Rx'd NSAIDs by us.",Blocking Inflammation May Be A Trigger for Future Chronic Pain - and Why Professional Philosophy Matters
