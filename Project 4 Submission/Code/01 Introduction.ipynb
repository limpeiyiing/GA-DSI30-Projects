    "In the United States, the West Nile Virus is one the most common mosquito-borne disease [(source)](https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/mosquitoes-in-the-us.html#:~:text=West%20Nile%20virus%20is%20one,Virgin%20Islands%2C%20and%20American%20Samoa.). Since its initial discovery in the country in 1999, it has rapidly spread throughout the country when an infected mosquito bites a human. In September 2001, the disease was initially discovered in two dead crows in Illinois. In contrast to the 149 cases and 19 deaths reported to the CDC cumulatively from 10 states during the three years from 1999 to 2001, the first significant WNV outbreak in the United States was observed in 2002, when more than 4,150 human cases and 284 deaths attributable to WNV infection were reported from 40 states.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2015, a total of **43,900 cases and 1900 deaths** linked to the virus were reported to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cases of hospitalized WNV disease are estimated to cost an average of [$56 million per year in disease-associated morbidity and mortality.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16311495) \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the majority of WNV carriers have no symptoms, one in five infected individuals have fever and other symptoms. Additionally, one in 150 infected individuals develops a serious, [occasionally deadly illness](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fwestnile%2Ffaq%2FgenQuestions.html). There are no vaccinations or treatments available currently for WNV in humans, and hence, the best way to manage WNV is by preventing it in the first place. This places a great importance on effective vector control strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2004, a thorough surveillance and control program had been built by the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), and it is still in use today. Mosquitoes caught in traps placed throughout the city from late spring through the fall are examined weekly for the virus. The outcomes of these tests determine when and where the city will spray insecticides into the air to reduce adult mosquito populations[(source)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/)."

    "A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322011/) estimated the economic impact of the outbreak to be **\\$2.28 million for medical treatment and patients productivity loss** for both West Nile fever and West Nile neuroinvasive disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the above study, and the following statistics, we would estimate that the healthcare and economic costs of a WNV outbreak in Chicago would be much higher due to the population density. In contrast, the area (and therefore, cost) to spray in Chicago would likely to be lower*. \n",
