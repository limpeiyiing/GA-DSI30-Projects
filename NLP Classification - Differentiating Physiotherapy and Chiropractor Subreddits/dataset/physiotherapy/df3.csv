physiotherapy,"Hi everyone, 

Firstly, I have searched for an answer to my queries here and have not found a full set of answers. I am from the UK, but currently in Malaysia, and I'd like to specifically ask my questions to any UK practitioners, simply because I trust the NHS and the evidence-based medicine they practise (I am less interested in complementary or alternative medicine (I am 99% sure that DN is alternative medicine, but not even sure!?)). 

I am from the UK and living in Malaysia because I am a teacher in an international school. I have an injury in my calf muscle and am seeing a physiotherapist for the first time. As far as I can tell they are practising Western Medicine. I am a Biology teacher and everything being explained regarding muscle knots and an injury through overuse/ chronic lack of enough Oxygen makes sense from my A-level level of knowledge. 

He's done some great deep tissue massage that was really satisfyingly painful and I felt improvement after the first session. He also gave stretches etc. In the second session (Tuesday just gone) he did dry needling. It was very painful and the needles were very deep in my muscles and the whole sensation and experience made me feel physically sick. I struggled to walk after and am still limping. He explained to me that the needles break down trigger points and said that this is practised in Western countries. 

My question is: would you as a UK based physiotherapist provide this treatment? I know the evidence is scant but I'd really appreciate the insight into what is happening in the UK. As said, it's the first time I've seen a physiotherapist. Is this normal treatment in the UK? Is it worth the nauseating pain?

physiotherapy,"Context: Aus new grad physio in private practice

Basically my new grad job hasn't lived up to my expectations and those that were agreed upon when I was interviewing for the role. Brief outline of the issues:
1. There's been no mentoring
2. No PD
3. My 1hr a week of documentation time is routinely booked over to fit in last minute patients
4. My caseload is close to 50% home health/aged care, which I was neither informed about when interviewing nor have any interest in doing 
5. Management is hostile when any concerns are raised 
6. IT infrastructure and facilities are of a third world standard
7. On multiple occasions demands have been made to perform additional work outside regular hours without being paid

There have been numerous other small issues not with mentioning. But basically I'm at a point where resentment has set in and I'm dreading going to work. I know my position at this place is no longer tenable and I need to move on for my own wellbeing but I'm hesitating..

physiotherapy,"Hi all! I’ll get straight to the point. I am a high school student currently preparing her high school baccalaureate exams in France (but I’m studying in an English school). For the past two years or so I had been vaguely interested in Physiotherapy and decided that I would apply to bachelor programs in physiotherapy. Now being an English speaker and having an international background I liked the idea of getting my degree in the Netherlands, because it is affordable, offers education in English but also closer to my home country. So I applied and got accepted into each of the universities proposing a physiotherapy bachelor. 

However, this year I decided to do much more research on physiotherapy as a profession and found that I as having really bad cold feet about doing this degree. This is mainly because the degree program that I applied to is:
1) a vocational degree so it is very specialized and I am afraid that it has little scope of change should I not like it 
2) taught from a very small university, and I can’t even practice in the Netherlands with this degree because I don’t speak Dutch
3) I am terribly afraid of committing 4 years of my life to a degree that is so specific right out of highschool.

What I do like however is the whole aspect of travelling and meeting new people but I also want to have a degree that I’m fully comfortable with. 

So my other option is to do the medical exams of France in French (which is okay because it is my mother tongue )
This means doing a preparatory class for one year after I graduate high-school in order to pass the medschool exam for France and potentially study medicine for a minimum of nine years. 
This is good because it’s giving me a chance to try for other health professions and maybe test my aptitude for medicine (who knows maybe I’ll actually like it) 
It’s more broad than the focused professional training of physiotherapy for example. 
However this choice is also super uncertain, as everything depends on one’s ranking on the competitive exams and if your ranking isn’t good enough, you do not qualify for medschool (so now you’re back to square one) 
So I now find myself in an awful dilemma: which study choice is better for me? 
I really need some form of advice to help me out, my mind is saturating at this point.. thank you so much",Choosing to study physiotherapy or medicine?

physiotherapy,"I was wondering if anyone has any advice or insight. 

I currently have a fallen arch on my left foot. Tore meniscus (mid-tear) a year and a half ago. Left glute activation (firing) requires a lot of effort. When I do hip exercises, left hip is very stiff. I have to currently manually flex my left glute and leg, to get my left foot to not arch. I noticed now and throughout past 3-5 years, my left foot grip is not that strong, and used to shift a little more to the left. I want to return to play soccer and run properly with confidence. 

Context - I had a meniscus mid tear about a year and a half ago. I used to play soccer few times a month. Regular men's pick up leagues. For the past 3-5 years I'd say I'd always have pain when playing soccer, but somehow goes away after playing for like 15 minutes (but I think this was because I had flat feet then, I did not realize I had flat feet then).  Also, planning to join a league in 3 weeks, competitive (once a week games), but not super competitive, as to what I am used to.

Due to the tear, I couldn't lift my left leg much when running, so I rested it and did not do alot of physical activity, worked out though on and off. I started going to drop in soccer with some friends, recreational games. 

I played a few men league games, friend called me up. I felt fine during the games, most probably due to deep stretching for lower body (hips, calves, etc). Also, using my knee brace, where I have straps that lock my knee in.

Also, I try flex my arch as much as possible, and notice I get way more sore now when walking and some pain. I feel l need some sort of custom soles. I also walk in sandals now at home, they provide me so much relief.

I will visit some professionals soon for further advice, it's that I do not have coverage at the moment as I contracting and actively looking for private insurance in Toronto, Canada.

This puts me at a disadvantage because for many classes I ended with an 88-89 and it was considered a B rather than a B+ bringing down my overall GPA. Also, I see that the Canadian GPA scale is different in terms of percentages. I had a few questions;

1. When PT schools calculate GPA do they use their own scales with my percentages? or do they use my letter grades? If they use my letter grades do they consider +/- or only what is written on my transcript? 
2. Do PT schools consider the fact that my school does not do +/-?
3. Are percentage grades included in final transcripts or is it only letter grades?
4. I know not many PT schools in Canada accept international students however for Mcmaster and UBC the case is different. Does anyone know the % of international students accepted into their PT programs?

Lastly, I would love to hear any advice from international students who applied to PT programs in Canada.

physiotherapy,"I'm a physiotherapy student having completed my placement and soon to graduate next year (Australia).

PFJ syndrome is by far the most frustrating thing to treat in my opinion, largely because it's so complex, the obvious treatments don't always work and those that *do* work don't entirely make sense.

Case in point, glute max strengthening; why does it work? I understand that for things like sit-to-stands or climbing stairs, having stronger hip extension lessens the requirement for active knee extension = less quads activity = less PFJ pressure.

However most people with PFJ pain (depending on the mechanism) have pain simply with walking. EMG studies and a bit of common sense shows that the glute max isn't involved in walking unless you take large, aggressive strides - yet the treatment *usually* works.

**tl;dl** a powerful glute max is only required for a few sparse actions across any given day but strengthening it can often improve pain at low-intensity tasks - why?",Why do patients with PFJ syndrome respond to glute max strengthening even though very few tasks require high glute max power

physiotherapy,"Hello everyone,

Hope your are all doing well!

Currently I am working on a project which focuses on providing artificial inteligence supervision and systematic monitoring of healing progress for patients at home. As far as I am aware, at least a small part of physiotherapy is related with prescribing exercises for futher rehabilitation at home.

In my collected knowledge after minor incidents or surgeries patients are evaluated and released home to rehabilitate on their own, mainly given a verbal ir written advice on what to do further. Ideally, appointments after several weeks are scheduled to track healing progress, however, not in every case.

That is why I am interested finding out whether physiotherapy specialist see the need for further supervision of their patients. Maybe it is an over exaggeration of problem that do not exist?

Any other thought on a subject would also be beneficial.

physiotherapy,"tl;dr: Which school/method of manual therapy have you learned or are you working with? Can you recommend it or would you prefer a different one?

Getting close to finishing PT school I'm starting to look for further education. Manual Therapy always intrigued me shadowing different mentors throughout the years. Starting my research I've come to find that there are way more schools than I thought and information comparing them is extremely rare. Of course this is because they each got different approaches and as far as I know not a lot of PTs will spend their money and time on multiple trainings but maybe some of you are more experienced and can offer their advice.

My personal findings thus far were that next to the classics like Kaltenborn, McKenzie, Sachse or Maitland there are some interesting new concepts. Are  reasons to prefer the more traditional methods?

physiotherapy,,"Hi everyone, I’ve got this scenario and im confused a bit, there’s a clue at the end says the patient has diabetes and hypothyroidism and i need to assess his shoulder but I don’t know how could this clue help me choosing wt test."
physiotherapy,"As a PT student (Australia), I am curious about many different things ranging from classic Physiotherapy pain science and rehabilitation to neuroscience, psychology and general health. Every day I talk to people asking what they think a private PT does, and the answer/expectations are always very similar: assessment, diagnosis, treatment, exercises, see you one week later, repeat.

As a PT student, I think I can help people more than just recovering from pain. What's stopping PT's from looking at someone's health as a whole? (I know many do, but the community generally \[N=25\] has a strict idea of our role, and venturing outside of this appears taboo). We did this heaps on clinical hospital placements, always checking blood pressure, reading charts and learning about how different medications might affect someone's ability to mobilise.

What is the reason that people can't come in and see PT's for a general health check up or basic health assessment? i.e. blood pressure check, whole body strength testing, cardiovascular fitness testing, assessing markers for longevity (whatever that means, not sure yet), quick mental health check in, etc. It seems that many people see personal trainers for this type of ""non-GP"" information. Why can't that be us? Or is it us? Idk!

Why can't people see PT's as the gateway to improved health overall, where patients come in asking ""how can I challenge my self-limiting beliefs?"", ""How can I begin developing good habits?"", ""How can I invest in my own health?"", ""what's the best way for me to begin exercising?""

I understand that some of this might just be a dream and seem outside of a PT's scope, but I can't help but think PT's could facilitate gen-pop's entry to overall health and exercise. And also not only taking people **in pain** to performance, but people **without** **pain** into performance/health.

Would love some opinions, as of course I am not yet in the industry, so there could be many problems here.

physiotherapy,"Hi, I'm starting my new job as physiotherapy assistant this month, and I'll be working in a hospital. The few people I've met so far have been really kind, and at first i was super excited but now I'm so scared 

I've only had 1 job before - working with disabled young people as a summer job - I'm 22, just finished uni (doing psychology, so not even medical related), I feel underqualified, like I'm going to mess everything up, and I shouldn't be working in a hospital, like I'm not smart enough. I'm worried I won't be able to handle the responsibilities or something! I'm going to get training for a bit before starting the job properly but I'm just really nervous. I keep imagining messing up and everyone being frustrated with me or getting mad at me, or getting myself fired:/ 

I have dyslexia which affects my ability to retain information properly and effects my memory and processing speed, and I always got told off for ""not listening"" at school, even though I was, I just had a hard time processing it and remembering instructions, especially if I couldn't write it down to reference it - what if this happens at the job? I told them about this and they were really understanding, I know I'm probably overreacting and catastrophising but it's just because I don't want to mess it up, especially for the patients 

Sorry for rambling, idk anyone else who works in hospitals or in this kind of job who I can ask for advice

physiotherapy,,"Where my chest meets my armpit, I can feel small bumps if I push down. Are these fibres, tissue, lymph nodes? Is this normal?"
physiotherapy,"So I was neglected and ignored as a child, hence why these things have only just been picked up.

So a couple of years ago, I saw a physiotherapist for the first time for a dry needling procedure to release painful trigger points all over my back (I have GAD). It worked very well. 

However, as soon as I walked in the room, the PT told me “you have low muscle tone”. I thought they meant I didn’t have much muscle (true), but they explained that they meant my muscles were “loose”, i.e. had lower resting tension than usual. I’ve always been horrible at sport, lean on everything, slump, lean while sitting, etc. 

They said it was still within the “normal” range, albeit right at the lower end, and that in my case it’s probably just genetic (my father and all of my siblings have it too).

I was talking before I was walking as a child (spoke early, didn’t walk until I was almost 18 months old).

I definitely do not have EDS, I’m rather inflexible and my skin is definitely not stretchy (it’s hard to grab it to try and stretch it), although both of my elbows hyperextend.
I do not have autism, after watching family videos of me as a toddler/young child and not having any autism-specific traits, although I was just diagnosed with ADHD, at the age of 22 (F).

Interestingly, all of my siblings and both of my parents fit the criteria for ADHD, but only one sibling, my youngest, fits the criteria for autism (she was very clearly different as an toddler/young child from the rest of us, and her autism is extremely high functioning).

So I was prescribed 10 mg methylphenidate 2 x daily. It fixed my low muscle tone. It also releases the muscles in my back which felt like a hard rock. I can feel my vertebrae in my lower back now. But my limbs, core muscles are “tighter” and I tire less, can use my strength with way less effort. I do things and expect to tire soon, but don’t. I can stand up for extended periods without feeling the need to lean on anything.

This effect wears off as the methylphenidate wears off. Other people have commented that I hold my body differently and look less “floppy” when I take it.

I just really want to understand WHY this could be happening.Is it dopamine? Noradrenaline? What could I be lacking that my muscles need to regulate their tension?",Low muscle tone - stimulant medication “fixes” it while it’s in effect?
