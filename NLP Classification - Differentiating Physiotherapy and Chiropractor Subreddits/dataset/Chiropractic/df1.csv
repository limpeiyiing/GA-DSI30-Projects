I've had some x-rays and it turns out I have facet joint degeneration in my cervical and upper thoracic spine. 

These were asymptomatic until I had a cervical adjustment at my chiropractors office. The next morning I had severe painful neck spasms (radiologist could see the alignment was off, said likely due to spasm).  

It's been more than a month, I've done masage, acupuncture, muscle relaxants, stretching, with minimal relief.

I recent was connected with a chiropractor for the first time in my life, I‚Äôm 26. At the time of writing this I‚Äôve had 2 adjustments. While I do feel less tense and stronger in the gym, immediately after adjustments I get very sad for no explainable reason.

Chiropractic,"Over the past few years I've had on and off pain in my piriformis either on the left or right, where it happens seems random. I do lift heavy weight very frequently as powerlifting has been something I've been doing for many years. The pain would come on for about a week and then when it's gone it's like it never happened and wouldn't bother me for maybe another half a year or longer.

About 3 weeks ago it started up again and this is the longest it's ever lasted which is what concerns me. In the time since I haven't been squatting or deadlifting. At its worst about 2 weeks ago the pain was so bad that doing things like getting out of bed was extremely painful and I'd be practically limping for the first minute or so. Going for walks was also 7/10 in pain and discomfort, and you could probably tell I wasn't walking normally. The pain would seem to move from my SI joint to my piriformis at different points in the day. 

I started going to a physio recently and I felt like they were only treating the pain temporarily, so I looked for a Chiro who historically has always helped me recover from my moderate lifting related injuries. The Chiro did an assessment (which partially included a glute bridge which was 9/10 pain), took x rays and did an adjustment on my SI, which I should say brought about the most sudden relief since this has started. I've had a few sessions and each one has left me feeling a bit better, all in all the pain has gone from 8.5/10 on average to 2/10 on average, which I'm extremely thankful for. My concern is will the few more adjustments I have scheduled eventually take this down to 0, or could this be something that needs an Orthopedic specialist? In a very generic sense, could the joint be structurally damaged? I'm really thankful for how much my Chiro has helped me, I just worry that adjustments will only get it so far. I'd like to get back to squatting and deadlifting but I really worry that even if the pain seems low, that could trigger whatever is going on again and take me back to square 1.",SI/Piriformis pain; is Chiropractic work enough for full recovery?

Chiropractic,"I know that's a loaded question. I'll start by saying, I'm not a chiro naysayer. My husband has some nerve damage/loss of sensation in his leg and was having some pretty rough neuropathy and he tried chiro after the neurologist just wanted to throw gabapentin at him. It worked. The pain is gone, the rest remains but we were never expecting a miracle.  


Anyhow...I've also started going. I'm probably about 3-4 months in and don't have any specific complaints other than being 40 and out of shape. My neck is my problem child and is perpetually tight, I also have two fused bones in there, but I've been told it's a common thing and probably isn't causing me issue. I was going a few times a week to start but am down to twice a month (my insurance only covers so many visits!). A typical visit seems to be about 2 minutes or adjustment, 10 on the traction table and DONE! I'm not sure the traction does much, I've never had a visit without it. Right now it's covered under my copay but when I run out of visits I think it costs almost $20 plus another $30 for the adjustment.  


The doctors we see rotates and each one seems to be a little different. One in particular seems to take a smidge of extra time with me and I find it noticeable. She does something akin to a massage before she adjusts my neck and does this ""hug"" type adjustment that is amazing. ...but she's not always there and even that is not always constant if they're busy.

Is that normal for care, am I expecting the wrong thing? One of the other doctors remarked on my neck and said my jaw was off but nothing different was done that visit. My favorite was talking about adjusting her boyfriend (also a chiro) and talked about doing ""an hour of work"" and while I certainly don't expect that for my $30 copay, it did get me wondering if I'm missing out.

I‚Äôve been suffering with upper back / shoulder blade / chest pain for 6 months now. 

Clear x-rays for the chest and doctor has me in PT which hasn‚Äôt done anything in a couple of months. 

So I decided to go to a chiropractor, being skeptical and actually told not to bother by my GP, it was a big step. 

So my first taste, I had a physical check over, hips, spine, neck and other locations and then did a strange thing where I had to close my eyes with my arms out in front and March high knees - I ended up totally rotated and at the other side of the room without realising! 

I then had an X-ray of my spine from the side and one from the front with my mouth wide open. 

It was informative, and I go back tomorrow to get my results and start a treatment plan. 

The only thing that concerned me a little was the doctor spent some time selling me a package to have 12 weeks worth of treatment, starting at 2 per week for the first 6 weeks and then less and less as time went on - it felt a bit ‚Äúsalesy‚Äù. 

Looking forward to the treatment and hopefully finally getting some relief.",First time for me today..

You prob face patients like this all the time...

Here‚Äôs the no.1 tips that I learned to increase patients‚Äô experience

So they can give you good testimonials, good reviews and refer you to their friends and family.

You have to treat your patients like a human.

You get to find find out your patient‚Äôs ‚Äòwhy‚Äô,

When they first come to your practice, ask them:

‚ÄòBefore taking your insurance, mind if I ask you a few questions first to see if I can actually help?‚Äô

Why are they here at your clinic? What have they tried? What works? What doesn‚Äôt?

What‚Äôs their goal?

and show them the transformation

Show them how you are going to help them.

Show them how their life will be after you helped achieve their goal.

Show them how you helped people like him to go through the process.

You don‚Äôt just crack their back, their neck,,,

You treat people who have fears, dreams and feelings.

They are not coming to Chiro just to get rid of knee pain, or go back to cross fit.

They are coming to you because the way crossfit makes them feel,

They want to go back to crossfit or play the sport they like because that makes them feel good.

If you are able to treat your patient like a human.

Make them feel like they are being treated like a human.

Not a cash generating tool.

Then, you‚Äôll start seeing more and more referrals coming to your practice.",‚ÄòI wish I knew all these before I even start my own Chiro practice‚Ä¶‚Äô
Chiropractic,"If you are a Chiro practice owner, I have something to share with you.

I saw a lot of practice owner trying different marketing strategies,

But only a handful of them actually are able to make it work.

I found that the biggest difference between them and the rest of their competitors is that they have a compelling USP.

A Unique Selling Proposition

They understand who they are trying to convey their marketing message to before they even start marketing their clinic.

They know who their dream patient is

And they understand how they are able to help their dream patient.

All they do is create a specific marketing that speaks to their dream patient.

When their dream patient sees it, their mind would be  ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs exactly my problem‚Äô, ‚ÄòHe totally gets me.‚Äô

So how do you create a USP?

In my understanding, USP is a clear statement describing what you do and how you can solve people‚Äôs needs.

An example would be: At ABC Physical Therapy, we help active people in XYC locations stay fit, healthy and mobile without pain medication, injections or surgery.

It clearly demonstrates to those people what you can help them with and what you can help them avoid.

In a language that your dream patient understands.

And I found most of those successful practice owners will put their USP on their website, their promotional materials, and even somewhere visible at their clinic.",Here's what I learned...

I am sitting up right on my bed right now, laptop, exactly what he says I am not to do.

He did manipulation, but also his staff got me to do a few exercises like the power plate with weights on one side of the head, and a contraption that pulls your chin, chest into a good posture. I need to go back quite a few times to get myself back into alignment apparently.

He said the manipulation he does is mostly an instant relief thing, but it's important to get my spine re-aligned with these exercises to treat root of the problem. 

Whenever I read about chiropractic, there's always those articles that cast doubt over it, but how everything has been explained and shown to me by this guy makes sense. 

Does this sound like good practice?",My experience of chiropractic so far

Chiropractic,"I am seeing a chiropractor who is doing the CBP treatment on me to help restore curvature to my spine which has had its curves become flattened (with neck kyphosis). He gave me Dennerolls for home care which I am supposed to use daily starting at three minutes for both cervical and thoracic, adding a minute per day until 15-20 minutes.

Chiropractic,"Hey guys

I recently started going to a chiropractor. Before each session they have you do some exercises and stretching. Is this pretty normal?  One of the exercises is this vibrating plate you stand on which is supposed to help you continue your positioning. So two questions actually. 1) is exercises with chiropractic normal? 2) is this vibrating stand a stupid scam? I've seen it marketed for weight loss.

Chiropractic,"Since ~5y I‚Äôm suffering under a lot of neck pain due to muscle tension, especially the left trap. While working out I often injured my right shoulder joint (tendonitis). 

After some time I got diagnosed with a true LLD via Scanogram of the legs. You can measure each bone individually and the result is, that my right leg is in total 1,5cm shorter. 

In addition i got pretty bad posture (forward roled shoulders, forward head, straight neck).

Since I‚Äôm wearing full length shoe lifts (6 Months Indoor &amp; Outdoor) my stance feels more balanced (my weight is not shifted to the right side anymore). 
Lower back pain when standing for long time got way better. 

But my neck pain / tension got worse. 
In addition to that - whenever I try to stand or sit upright, with my shoulders pulled back and doing a slight chin tuck, something in my back cracks very loud when I take a deep breath. It repeats with every 2-3nd breath while maintaining upright posture. 
When I put my hands over my traps I can feel the pop only on my left side, below the collar bone &amp; tissue. 
So my guess is, that maybe the first or second left rib is slipping / popping due to the tension around my neck / upper back. I think it might be the costovertebral joint since it‚Äôs coming from the back not the front of the ripcage. 

Since I‚Äôm adapting to a new body static with my hips being levels again - my muscle imbalances still pulling my spine back. Could that be the culprit? What can I do for a proper diagnosis? Every doc told me that this popping is nothing to worrie about but it‚Äôs driving me nuts. It occurs literally every 2-5min and can‚Äôt be normal. It doesn‚Äôt hurt but the tension increases after.

Chiropractic,"Hello everyone,

I started seeing a chiropractor to try to avoid having back surgery for a L5 S1 Injury. They wanted to do a fusion with a cage and all that fun stuff. I have 6 subexations  In my spine and my neck is off a few degrees, the disks are getting close to touching. I haven't had my grains for about 4 or 5 years, I used to get them about once a year and they would send me to the ER with emergency spinal taps and all that fun stuff.

As of late I have been getting a migraine about every 3 to 4 weeks weeks. I don't think there is severe as they usually are but it still seems kind of odd. I am doing multiple different types of exercises for my neck, including the denner roll, and something where I stretch my neck from a door from a device that braces the back of my head and under the chin.  I am unsure the name of it. 

Anyways, is this pretty common or anything to be worried about?  I almost wondered if my neck was getting so bad that maybe it was preventing me from getting my migraines, for whatever reason that may be. Maybe now that I'm stretching my neck and kind of opening up the disks maybe I'm starting to get the migraines that I originally had before? I hope not but it sure sucks.",migraines after care?

Chiropractic,"Hi! So, long story as short as I can keep it: I‚Äôm 28F and have been dealing with episodic vertigo, dizziness and tinnitus for about 2 years. I‚Äôve already seen multiple ENTs, neuro-ontologists and neurologists; I‚Äôve also done PT, seen an allergist, had multiple tests done, had extensive blood work, etc.

I also briefly saw a Blair chiro, but had a bad experience (he was very sales-y, using words like ‚Äúcure‚Äù and ‚Äúrelieve‚Äù very loosely among other things). I‚Äôll be honest, he turned me off chiro for a while. Recently, my current acupuncturist  (who‚Äôs covering for my main one who‚Äôs away on leave) recommended atlas orthogonal for me. She recommend this because it‚Äôs really helped her with similar symptoms. And even when I went to PT, I was told how off my C1 and C2 are and know how incredibly tight my neck and traps are. 

I was apprehensive, but did my research and found an AO near me. I have to say, I really like him so far. He‚Äôs not sales-y at all, not making me any big promises (unlike the last guy), and is very generous with his time. He adjusts the atlas, of course, but he‚Äôs also trained in trigger point therapy, which he incorporates in his treatment. I love that, as I went in knowing how big of an issue trigger points are for me. 

That said, while I‚Äôm glad I found someone I‚Äôm comfortable with, I want to make sure I‚Äôm being objective in determining how effective this ends up being for me. I‚Äôve already tried multiple things and spent a lot of money, so I‚Äôm very cautiously optimistic. 

So far, I‚Äôve only done 2 sessions. I know these trigger points are really bad and need to be dealt with, so im hopeful for that aspect, but I‚Äôm not yet sure how helpful the Atlas adjustment itself will be.  

 Few days after my 1st adjustment, I had an unexpected dizzy episode where I had really bad head pressure + throwing up. I don‚Äôt think this was necessarily the adjustment‚Äôs fault, as I had also been running + I‚Äôll admit I did some extra trigger point work on my own, so I think it was all too much for my body at once, which my acupuncturist also said. 

Anyway, would 3 months be a fair amount of time to really give this a chance? (I‚Äôve heard mixed things on how long it should take to help, if it does, so that + knowing neurological issues can be more complex is how I came at 3 months)",How long is fair (on average) to give Atlas Orthogonal a chance?

Chiropractic,"Hi everyone,

I have been seeing a upper cervical chiropractor for around a month due to headache and brain fog, and I always feel slightly dizzy the whole of next day after adjustment - she uses Blair technique.

My headaches have definitely been lesser but it may also could be due to my recent identification on what triggers and my ongoing anti depression pills that I‚Äôve been taking before even seeing (My headache came back from exercising a month after those anti depressants work).

I still have about 18 sessions and pre-paid - sorry i know im dumb but I was desperate, so I would like to ask if it‚Äôs normal to feel dizzy the next day, it really affect my processing as my head feels heavy and typing on the computer is harder.","Dizziness from upper cervical chiro, is it normal?"

Chiropractic,"Hey chiros, after 4 long years I am finally going to get my license this month! I have signed my first contract and will be working in a small town up in Canada. I am looking for advice on whether or not I should sign with another clinic. 

A little context for the second clinic that I may sign with: 

\- I completed my externship/internship/preceptorship with this second clinic I may sign with and it was an underwhelming experience

\- I have had a long-standing relationship with the clinic owners (one of which is a chiro) but the relationship soured when I tried to negotiate my contract 

\- The second clinic is very busy and I would work there 2-3 days/week while working 3 days a week at my other clinic

\- The second clinic is a 50-minute drive from where I will be living (I live in rural Canada so am used to driving but 50 mins in the winter will be difficult

\- I am split 50-50 on whether or not to pick up extra days with the clinic that I have already signed with or work at this second and would like to make a decision by the end of this weekend

Chiropractic,"Hello! This is my first post here, and I'm posting because no amount of Google searching has given even semi-helpful information. So, when I switched to my current chiropractor a couple years ago, while discussing my x-rays and records, he told me one of my issues is that my right hip is disconnected. From my memory, he said that the front and back aren't connected like they should be, or something similar. 

This made sense to me because I've always had problems with my right hip -  it can easily roll out/partially roll out of joint when I sit in certain positions. Very painful, but can't do anything about it and it just slowly shifts back by itself as I limp around and/or sit. Has never happened with the left hip as my left hip is normal.

Anyways, what the heck would my hip condition be called??? I was gonna search for good exercises to perform with it, but when I search for the correct terminology, all I get are results for ""dislocation,"" ""subluxation,"" and ""hip dysplasia"" - none of which describe my problem. If you have any inkling of an idea, please share the terminology with me.
