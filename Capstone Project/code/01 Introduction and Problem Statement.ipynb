    "A **good sales forecast** is an important core for every business. It helps in overall business planning, budgeting, and risk management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, a sales forecast addresses the following:\n",
    "1) **WHAT** products are going to be sold\n",
    "2) **HOW MUCH** of the product is expected to sell\n",
    "3) **WHERE** will the product be sold\n",
    "4) **WHEN** will the product be sold\n",
    "\n",
    "An inaccurate sales forecast can be a risk to the business in several ways. Mainly:\n",
    "1) **Underforecasting**:   If insufficient product arrives too late or at the wrong location to be sold, the business loses revenue opportunities and customer confidence. \n",
    "2) **Overforecasting**:   If too much product is supplied based on an over-estimated forecast, resources are wasted to manage the storing and handling of slow-moving product. Such resources could have better been directed into other investments that are more profitable for the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "While creating a reasonably accurate **bottoms-up sales forecast** doesn't necessarily need to be rocket science, the process can get increasingly complex and time-consuming to perform manually, especially when large number of location-category-item combinations are involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Automating this process with machine learning would help to significantly cut down processing time while maintaining a reasonable degree of accuracy.**\n"
