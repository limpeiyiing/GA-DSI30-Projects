Chiropractic,"I worked for a NUCCA chiropractor for a little over a year. It was just me and him and the office wasn’t very busy. He checked me every week and if the measurements said I needed adjusted he would do it. The longer I worked there, the worse my measurements got and the worse I felt. He blamed stress, sleeping habits, or would just kind of shrug it off and say it could be a lot of things causing it. I’ve never had neck pain in my life before this job. I was a healthy 22 year old when I started and when I left I had chronic neck pain that I still have trouble with 5 years later. Could this potentially be something he did?

Now, I’m not trying to say I’m 100% sure it was him, but this doc was kind of insane, so I feel I have a right to question it. He did a lot of strange things almost like he researched how to get people to do what he wanted in all of his spare time (just as an example one time he had me buy him shoe polish because there was a scuff on my own shoes… he did this instead of just asking me to fix my shoe situation. He was trying to “teach” me to fix it, which is a method he used with patients too). As time went on I found some sketchy billing practices and confronted him about it. He was definitely not happy with me and tried to tell me that it was all fine, but I pressed the issue anyway. I stuck it out a few more months, but ended up leaving. All of this to say, I wouldn’t put it past him because I sincerely believe this guy is a sociopath. I’m just trying to figure out if it’s even possible it was him because he’s the only cause I can think of. My neck pain is almost always in the occiput-C1 area.",Ever since NUCCA treatment I get horrible neck pain
Chiropractic,"We know playing “medical telephone” doesn’t always yield the best results for patients or providers. So what’s your favorite/best/most dramatic example of a complete misinterpretation a patient left with.

Ex: I told a patient to do this forearm stretch just until it started to get painful. He came in for follow up a few days later saying he felt way worse, after discussing what he had been doing the past few days he told me he had been doing the stretches just like I said, “until it hurts”. I had him demonstrate and he was cranking and holding the stretch until it was physically to painful to bear.

Lesson learned in communication… But I’m still pretty new at all this, let’s see what you veterans have.

Chiropractic,"Hi guys

Seems a bit unusual, just want to know if this is common, or if we should see a doctor or something?

My wife is 25 weeks pregnant and has been having a lot of back pain from working on her feet a lot, so decided to go see a chiropractor.

First appointment was all good, but on the second, she immediately felt dizzy after the appointment and ended up fainting and hitting thr deck in the waiting room while trying to pay.

Her blood pressure is usually on the lower end and the chiro said that's probably the reason? Should we be worried? She says she feels fine an hour later.",Pregnant wife fainted after seeing chiropractor
Chiropractic,"I've been seeing my chiropractor for the past year and he's been great, but on my last two visits he's stopped any treatment of my knees and instead spent a lot of time touching the bottom of my butt, he's also very chatty but gets very quiet during this part. It makes me uncomfortable but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting and this is a normal practice or something else.

Chiropractic,"I went to Palmer and became a Chiropractor because I was passionate about it and saw how it helped my dad. Unfortunately, I have two bulging and herniated discs and have constant back pain. I’ve had chiropractic treatments, have gotten epidural shots, physical therapy, and sooo much more. My back isn’t getting better and adjusting so many patients a day makes it worse. I wake up everyday with intense back pain and my quality of life has significantly gone downhill because of it. I have been extremely depressed and even attempted suicide…I’m in therapy for that now. 

Bottom line is that my body can’t handle the physical pressure that comes with being a chiropractor. I’m in pain all the time and the weekends give my body some reprieve but it’s not enough to recover. I feel like an exhausted zombie throughout the week. I want to do a career change and go into a career that isn’t as labor intensive…possibly in management or work from home. But I don’t want to go back to school and get more student loans. Is there any other career I can go into with a chiropractic degree that isn’t labor intensive?

I’m not sure if it helps but I graduated last year and currently work for The Joint and I see about 45 patients a day. I love everything about The joint…the work environment isn’t toxic, the pay is good, they are helping pay off my student loans, my patients adore me, it’s fulfilling, etc. My body just can’t handle the patient load. I make about $85,000 per year. I would like to continue to make the same salary so I can pay off my student loans. I also don’t have anything saved up to start my own clinic. I am saving for a down payment on a house now and then will start saving for my own clinic after that. But there’s a long way until that happens. I don’t think my body can handle this load for more than three more months. I’m at a breaking point and just trying to survive and make it another day. Any advice would be helpful? Has any chiropractor made a career change before?",I made a mistake by becoming a Chiropractic Doctor…how do I pivot into another career track?

Chiropractic,,Chiro assistant was shocked at my scan :/ help..
Chiropractic,"I had my first chiropractic session ever last week, and after many tears and back spasms am wondering if this is representative of what chiropractic adjustments are supposed to be.

I was referred over to a chiropractor by my midwife after I went in with what I can only describe as crippling sciatica-like pains down my leg. It was bad enough that I had to call into work one morning because I couldn't even crawl to the bathroom that night without screaming in pain.

So at 25wks I went in to see a chiropractor who specialized in prenatal care. She talked to me for about a minute or two about my concerns before getting me face down on the table. 

She was only working on my back a few seconds before she started to hit spots that were triggering extremely painful areas. I immediately started getting those shock cries (those times when something is so painful your body just reacts and tears up). Only a few minutes later, the paper on the table in front of my face was soaked through with tears. While she asked if I was doing okay and changed the paper, overall the chiropractor didn't seem concerned at my level of discomfort. She asked to work on my upper back and hesitantly I agreed. She popped something that made me scream. 

After that, she had me turn to my back so she could adjust around the front of my hips. Maybe a minute later she was done.

All total, the chiropractor worked on me for no more than 10min. She asked that I return the next morning. I did not. I paid the fee and got out. I spent the rest of the day with more spasms in more places than before. If it hadn't been covered by insurance, it would have been $147.

I ended up calling a trigger point therapist masage friend who has since worked on me twice now - each session lasting 30min to 1hr. Both times I've come away being able to walk normally, pain free, and with the feeling that someone took enough time to really work with me.

To me, the chiropractic appointment felt rushed, impersonal and, of course, extremely painful. Is this normally what first visits are like? If it is, how do chiropractors expect cliens to continue returning? If it's not normal, what is?

Thank you. I really try to keep an open mind. So if what I experienced is not a good representation of chiropractic medicine, then I want to know.

P.S. Moderators: your subreddit won't let me spell ""masage"" correctly without marking the two ""s's"" as a swear. :p","Did I experience a ""normal"" first visit?"
Chiropractic,I fell at the end of 2020 at work and have been seeing a chiropractor since. Once my back felt better from my fall at work (which took a while) I now still go once a month for maintenance adjustments. Anyways I knew I had a curve in my upper back that always to me seemed too curved. My chiropractor said I have kyphosis. Before I started going to him my back was always so stiff especially in the curved area. I do still sometimes get pain in my lower back where it curves inward to compensate if I lay wrong or something but but usually it’s not bad now that I get adjustments. My chiropractor says pretty much just live with it unless it’s debilitating me (which it isnt.) I was just wondering if kyphosis at 32 is something I should be really worried about or if it’s fine as long as it’s not bugging me too much? Also is there anything that I could do at home to help if it gets stiff or something or just stiff in general to help?,Is having kyphosis at 32 something I should be worrying about?

Chiropractic,"They did X-rays of my lower back and neck twice for each area. The second appointment they did what I'm guessing was a slight neck adjustment. I heard a cracking noise and for about 30 seconds afterwards, I felt totally relaxed. It was an odd feeling, but nothing bad by any means.

Chiropractic,"I'm a Parker student who is more than half way through the DC program. Within the last year or so, the school implemented a strict requirement of completing roughly 20 hours of community service (1 credit = 2 hours) in order to graduate. We were told that our licenses, transcripts, and other accounts would be on withheld until we finish those community service hours upon graduation. Normally I'm 100% in support of community service and I think it's a great way to give back. However, we can only acquire credits via opportunities that the school administration creates, which may be far and few in between.   


I'm not sure if other schools also have this kind of requirement. But I find it increasingly difficult to deal with the Parker school administration and their weird rules. There's only 1 or 2 events per trimester and somehow they always end up happening during exam weeks. Personally, I'd rather spend that time practicing my technique instead of spending time manning a table at a school event. I'm starting to dread the idea of being held back just because of community service hours.",Does your chiropractic school require community service hours to graduate?
Chiropractic,[deleted],"I’ve had pain in left leg/hip/glute, and also front right groin area. I had an adjustment for rotated pelvis yesterday. However my pain is still there. Now my glut/hip pain is still bad but leg is better. Does it usually take some time to heal? Or if the adjustment didn’t work?"
Chiropractic,"For those not aware, there is a historical concept in chiropractic technique referred to as ""retracing."" It's still talked about a LITTLE bit today, certainly not as much as there was 25 years ago or before that, in my experience. The basic concept of retracing was used to educate patients who would have exacerbation of symptoms after adjustment, and the explanation was essentially that if you've been in pain for a long time sometimes you have to ""go back through it"" because of the way the nervous system works. Obviously vague, somewhat questionable, doesn't really explain anything. I've never personally liked the explanation. 

Interestingly, the concept of retracing seemed to come up the most with longterm/ongoing pain and a lot less so with more acute patients, and I don't think that is on accident. I think retracing actually is a thing, and there is a modern explanation for it. 

In some longterm/ongoing pain cases, there are nociplastic changes that occur, in other words, the CNS actually undergoes some wiring/firing changes that relate to this process. One of the characteristics of ongoing pain and central sensitization/nociplasticity is something called ""latency."" Latency is, IMHO, what chiropractors traditionally called ""retracing."" In pain patients, latency is a delay between stimulus and response. 

Some examples of how latency looks in a patient case:

* Patient is more active than usual or starts doing their home exercises or whatever and they don't feel symptoms resulting from that until a day or two later. This is part of why there is such a disconnect in these patients between alleviating and aggravating factors because the time delay makes it hard for the patient to connect activity with how the activity felt. 
* Patient has exacerbation of symptoms related to treatment, or testing, even. Classic scenario is if you do much neurodynamic testing/treatment with patients, it often feels fine when you're doing it but then the patient is laid out the next day or two. 

In the pain science world, latency is thought to be coming from an immune response, of all places, which takes time, hence, exacerbation of symptoms 24-48 hours later. Some ongoing pain patients have glial cell changes that affect glial cell activity and their release of cytokines (some of which are pro-inflammatory and some of which are anti-inflammatory, depending on the location of cytokine activity and the types of cytokines). Depending on the patient and their situation, one of the ""super systems"" that overlie their pain experience (which is an output) can be an increased immune system response and the subsequent glial cell and cytokine activity changes that come with that output. I believe these are the patients that have some worsening after adjustments who would have had the ""retracing explanation"" in some chiro offices of old.",A modern explanation for the old school concept of retracing?

Chiropractic,"I'm wondering how real chiropractors are feeling about these quacks using their chiropractor license to peddle insane nonsense. I went to three different chiropractors and each one was peddling nonsense and hardly any actual adjustments. They would tell me to push my arm against them while having a paper on my chest that had words like ""dairy, gluten, nuts etc."" They would then say I have an allergy to one of those things (inconsistent by the way). They wanted from $3,000 - $4,500 for just about 10 visits. One guy even had a poster om his wall that said ""A good patient will put care over all their finances and will not ask questions"" I told them to shove it obviously. I found out that this is called applied kinesiology and it's insanity. 

I found a legit chiropractor finally and it's made a huge difference just after my first visit. Not to mention it's only $250 for an 8 visit package with all the works. I'm worried these people using their license to peddle nonsense and charge insane fees will hurt the entire industry.

Evaluation of the individual motion segments demonstrates the following:

--C5-6 level: Mild annular bulge and small broad-based central disc protrusion, which partially effaces the ventral thecal sac. Mild canal narrowing. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.

Chiropractic,"Sorry in advance for the long post..I’ve been seeing a highly-rated chiropractor in my area (US) since summer 2021 for back pain after a car accident. She took x-rays &amp; did an assessment and determined I had severe misalignment in my hips &amp; neck and mild in my back. She determined correcting my neck to be the most important to improving my back pain and in order to do that recommended a treatment plan of 3x a week adjustments (hip, back, neck) with neck traction for 4 months. I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed like a lot, but I did well the first two months where I felt pain relief after the adjustments. But then I had a period of a month or so where I felt worse after adjustments. I expressed my concern and she had an explanation for it (to summarize, it wasn’t her it was me.) She extended the 3x week treatment beyond the initial 4 month recommendation &amp; eventually I felt better after adjustments again. In January 2022 &amp; I told her I couldn’t keep up with the 3x a week adjustments because it was becoming cost prohibitive (&amp; I was feeling pretty good overall) so she said we should take x-rays again and RE-assess. X-rays showed small changes in the right direction but still nowhere near “normal.” She then recommended 1x week adjustments with traction, which I’ve been doing for the most part with the occasional 1x every 2 weeks. Lately I’ve been feeling worse after the adjustments again &amp; can’t help but feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I don’t really care what my x-rays look like as long as I’m feeling better, but her philosophy is that I won’t remain pain-free unless my alignment issues are actually corrected. Is this a standard course of chiropractic care/treatment? I can’t imagine most people having to go weekly forever in order to be pain free &amp; even if they did, perhaps their alignment will never be considered “normal” but they will still feel OK.

Now how he was able to come to that conclusion is by looking at the MRIs I brought him form another doctor as well as the x rays he took at his office.

At first I accepted it, but then my alarm bells started ringing. How did my orthopedic doctor miss this? I tried asking my chiropractor the same question, but he basically said that regular medical doctors “just look at the bigger picture and aren’t concerned with the smaller details”. That further set off my alarms.

Another thing that made me give him
The side eye is his medical diagnosis. I understand that a lot of chiropractors have specialized training. But this guy did not go to medical school and I doubt he has the certification to be diagnosing anybody…right?",Don’t know how to feel about chiropractor’s diagnosis…
Chiropractic,"I've only had one experience with a chiropractic office.  I found it very contrived w/ more of a pushy sales pitch than I'm used to experiencing with a doctor.  Thus admittedly, I'm a bit weary of them, but I have a **very close friend that insists one would be able to fix my pain pretty quickly.**

It used to be standard to hear that you shouldn't go to them with inflammatory arthritis, but it looks like that recommendation may be outdated. 

My back is becoming a growing problem for me--mild to debilitating pain most of the time. 

I'm a big fan of crowdsourcing so here goes...

**Is it likely that the *average* chiropractor would be a good idea in my circumstances?  And if so, how would it be determined that there is no inflammation in the joints at each time of adjustment?**

Given:

- 42yo, female, 5'10"", 155lbs
- PsA - Psoriatic inflammatory arthritis diagnosed 15 years ago (being treated by rheumatologist with biologics)
- Some spinal deformity and degeneration (noted in attached MRI results)
- my back has ""gone out"" (spasmed to the point of complete immobility) twice since the MRI;
- as with all professions, there are practitioners ranging from TERRIBLE to GREAT in skill and ethics; and,
- it can be very difficult to find the best in a field without trial and error so I'm (hopefully) likely to start with a (hopefully) _average_ chiropractor.

Thank you, **THANK YOU**, for all considered and thoughtful responses!!!",HELP!!! Is it LIKELY a Chiropractor could help me given spinal deformity AND psoriatic inflammatory arthritis??? (Prefer doctors' responses - MRI findings included in post)

Chiropractic,"Hello Docs, I am currently in in Q6 and its becoming clear that just getting a chiropractic doctorate isn't going to suffice. I know that I would like to take seminars but with so many I am getting overwhelmed in what discipline to get into. Does anyone have any advice on some good seminars that they feel that all chiros should attend? I guess I'm just afraid to trail and error with seminar's considering they are usually pretty expensive and I'm already stressed enough about how expensive school is. Is there any resource that you can think of that will steer me towards choosing what's right for me? I attend clubs, but i feel foolish choosing what speciality to go into when I have little knowledge on the topic and if it actually works.

Chiropractic,"I’d really love to hear your opinions and experiences since I’m starting my DC program this fall. I’m currently attending a 4-year state school, however I will not be graduating with a B.S. since I’ve met the school’s 90-credit requirement. I decided to save money on undergrad tuition and start grad school a year earlier rather than spending another year obtaining a Kinesiology degree (which is pretty much useless unless you go to grad school anyways). I’ve just been lurking on this sub and can’t help but feel a little discouraged and I am starting to wonder if I am making the right choice. I know that this career requires a lot of hard work and effort to achieve success, and I’m definitely up for challenging myself, however I can’t help but feel scammed by the debt to income ratio. I think overall the job will bring great satisfaction and I find many aspects of being a chiropractor to be extremely rewarding, but at the end of the day money makes this world go round. I’d love to hear some of your inspiring journeys to success and also am curious to see who regrets their decision to pursue this career? If you could go back to before you started your first term of chiro school, would you do things differently? I definitely don’t want to be in a position where I regret my choices after paying tuition.",Are you happy/content/comfortable as a chiropractor?

Chiropractic,"Last night I put my hands on the back of my head and pulled forward, I did it as hard as I can to force a crack in the back of my neck, it didn’t crack, but popped so loud, it was one pop that felt intense and mt neck immediately felt sore after. No real pinched nerve type pain, I can move my neck in all directions the same, and the pain was gone last night by the time I fell asleep, but I woke up and my neck so sore. I did go to the emergency room last night when my right leg was feeling a little numb, it scared me and the fact that I didn’t feel a pinched nerve type of pain but I knew I popped my neck in a way I’ve never felt it pop like before, I figured if I pinched a nerve or hurt myself it should hurt worse. I started being scared I had tore an artery. The doctor took X-rays of my neck and said everything looked fine, (which was a relief) anyone have a similar experience and know what’s going on with my neck? I do wanna add in that I have t had any shoulder pain or any of my normal chronic neck pain from my bad posture, and I get nauseas and headaches every day, haven’t had one since last night. Is it possible I adjusted my own neck by accident? Lol would love any insight",Hey I cracked my neck and it was weird
Chiropractic,"Bit of a silly question is sweating during an adjustment common?  I just had an adjustment that was really needed… it had been like 4 months and I was all out of alignment.  During the adjustment my whole body started sweating.  Luckily I was wearing a long sleeve shirt but had shorts on and felt a bit embarrassed because even my legs were sweating like crazy.  The chiropractor was cool about it and I even asked for a towel but it was crazy honestly. I definitely think I had a toxic release if that is really thing.  Is this common to see patients?  

Next time I’m gonna where sweatpants too lol. I definitely already feel better mobility wise though…",Sweating during adjustment
Chiropractic,"Years ago I had a patient with moderate lower back pain.  She was a middle aged, somewhat fit person.  She was having some trouble getting prone on the table so I could begin checking leg length etc.  Once that was done, and was reasonably sure she was ready for an adjustment, I told her to 'roll over'... before I could say 'face up' she rolled right off the table onto the floor.   

Needless to say, my heart skipped a beat... reached to help her up...  had her just lie there for a moment to see if she was ok.  She stood right up. wiggled her hips and said 'well, there we go!, I think that helped.'   

It was a running joke in the office for a long time.  She would often ask the staff if she could fall off the furniture every once in a while for maintenance care.

I did a neck manipulation last Friday for head pressure, brain fog, on/off headaches which could be due to a concussion that I have suffered two months back. I also had bouts of headaches for three weeks and vertigo for one day back in November.

Chiropractic,"I am wondering if anyone with a similar issue as mine has had success with chiropractic work? I am having pretty severe neuropathic pain in left arm that radiates from neck. Currently on celebrex, gabapentin and flexoril. It basically masks the pain but i still feel pain through it. 

Here is what the MRI says:  

C5-6 level demonstrates a large central/right paracentral disc protrusion. Disc protrusion indents the ventral surface of the spinal cord. In the midline, AP dimension of the thecal sac is estimated at 8mm, indicating moderate-severe stenosis. Mild left foraminal narrowing is seen. 

C6-7 level demonstrates a very large, broad left paracentral and proximal foraminal disc extrusion. Disc pathology and measures up to 6 mm in AP dimension and extends about 4 mm below the C6-7 disc space. The disc material almost completely effaces the left ventral subarachnoid space. There is asymmetric indentation upon the spinal cord, left worse than right. In the midline, AP dimension of the thecal sac is 8 mm indicating at lease moderate-severe spinal canal stenosis. There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing at this level.   

Been doing physical therapy for three weeks with slight improvement. Have an appointment in two weeks with a pain clinic. I am wondering if a chiropractor could help prior to the pain clinic? Thanks.",Anyone have a chiropractor help with disc extrusion and protrusion in cervical spine?
