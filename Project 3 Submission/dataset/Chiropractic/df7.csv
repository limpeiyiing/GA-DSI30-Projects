Chiropractic,"Hey, good night. 
I had and accident two years ago, that lead me to cervical instability (atlantoaxial instability) and I received chiropractic care after the accident, it was the traditional way of chiropractic. (and I think is the only type of chiropractic care in my country, I live in Mexico) and it helped but not totally, I mean, I still can't lift weight and have a terrible neck, shoulder, jaw and arms pain, even my jaw is in wrong place. I can't turn my head or use a car without a cervical collar. And I have a lot of neuralgias in my face and head.
I started chiropractic care last weak but not traditional way, because the chiro uses the activator tool. 
My question is if this method could help me? 
I'm honestly desperate, sad and kind of hopeless about everything, have been receiving medical treatment but it's only a lot of pills for chronic pain, I miss living life, and my parents and I have treated a lot of therapies but nothing seems to help. 
And also, can Jaw misalignment be the reason why other therapies including chiropractic care (traditional) didn't help? 
It feels like when they adjust my spine or my body, take like minutes for everything go back in the wrong place (usually because of normal movements or cold weather, because my muscles are stiff and contractured)",cervical instability and chiropractic care

Chiropractic,"Most people know that chiropractors can help with back and neck pain, but what many people don't know is that chiropractic care can also help improve your overall health. Chiropractors are experts in spinal health and can help to correct misalignments in the spine, which can lead to a number of problems elsewhere in the body. Some of those may include headaches, migraines, and fatigue. Here are some common reasons that people turn to chiropractors for help with their health:

1. Chronic back pain is a leading cause of missed workdays or missed time at home with your family. When you experience chronic back pain, it can be difficult to focus on anything else, making it difficult to stay productive at work or be present for your loved ones. A chiropractor can help you find relief from your back pain and restore your ability to focus on what is important in your life.

2. Headaches and migraines are other common problem that many people experience. These painful headaches can leave you feeling drained and unable to enjoy your day. A chiropractor can work with you to identify the root cause of these headaches and provide treatment options that can help reduce or eliminate these headaches altogether.

3. Fatigue is another common problem for many people, especially if they are dealing with chronic pain or illness. If you find yourself feeling excessively tired, it can be difficult to get through your day. A chiropractor can help to improve your overall energy levels and help you feel more rested, so you can better handle whatever comes your way.

4. If you are dealing with a chronic illness, such as arthritis, diabetes, or fibromyalgia, a chiropractor can help to improve your overall health. These conditions can often lead to pain, fatigue, and reduced quality of life. A chiropractor can help to improve your symptoms and help you to better manage your condition.

5. Chiropractic care is also helpful for pregnant women. Many pregnant women experience back pain, which can make it difficult to enjoy the pregnancy and prepare for the birth of their baby. A chiropractor can help to improve your spinal health and reduce back pain, so you can focus on what is important—your growing baby.

Is chiropractic treatment more than just back pain? A Tacoma patient asked Dr. Bradley Eyford, a prominent [chiropractor in Tacoma](https://thehealthconnection-tacoma.com/). Dr. Eyford responded straightforwardly:- If you are looking for improved overall health and wellness, consider turning to a local chiropractor for help. They can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your health problems and provide natural, effective treatment options that can help improve your overall health.",Chiropractic Care - Is It Morthan Just Back Pain - Asked a Tacoma Patient

Hello Docs,

As I’m sure some of you are aware, this video has been circulating. Link shows a chiropractor performing cervical manipulation on a person experiencing symptoms of heart attack on a flight. 

According to the post, 5 MDs were at a loss and the pilot was considering an emergency landing. DC steps in and moments later the patient regains consciousness (more info is needed). 

Instagram comments have flooded the post, with DCs supporting and going against his actions. MDs have also chimed in. Mostly trolls still. 

Docs, let’s discuss. If it were you on that flight and every option was exhausted, and the patient’s wife gave you permission to adjust, would you? Why or why not?

Chiropractic,"Hopefully this doesn't break the rules as I don't want medical advice, I'm just a clueless family member that needs some guidance in my own research.


My grandad (78) has had a bad back and hip for 5+ years, nothing unusual there. It was slowly getting worse but he was still fully mobile, didn't struggle to carry shopping or other daily tasks. 


Through the NHS he went to a chiropractor, apparently everything he did was painful, so no specific movement or action stood out from the rest. But come the evening the original hip pain was getting worse and has continued to do so since, to the point he can no longer walk, drive or even sit at the dining table.


It's been around 6 weeks since the appointment, the GP have upped his painkillers and given him tramadol as well. They don't seem to have any interest in why the increase of pain has occurred, they haven't scheduled any examinations or x-rays. So that's why I'm here.


I'm wondering if anyone here has an idea what could have potentially caused this? I just need some direction for my research, don't worry I won't be quoting any of you in a doctor's appointment.

Chiropractic,"I went in for an adjustment last week and mentioned to my chiropractor in passing that I had the flu the week before. She asked if I frequently get sick (because I'm a teacher and work around kids all the time) and I said that I do, fairly frequently, about 2 or 3 colds throughout the fall and winter. She then said that she had something that might help with that called Thymus. 

She went and got a sample bottle and had me lay down and raise my left arm up in the air. She put the bottle on my chest and tried to push my arm down while I was able to resist. Then she took the bottle away and pushed my arm down easily. She said that this supplement would be helpful for me and although she didn't have any more in stock right now, would order some for me. This all happened before I really even had a chance to ask what the supplement was. I also have to admit that I am highly skeptical of the arm thing -- I just fail to see why a glass bottle on my chest would have any effect on my ability to push my arm down, or why that would be related to my immune system. 

Finally, before I left, she asked me if I had the COVID vaccine, and I said that I did. She said that it destroys the immune system because of the spike proteins it contains. I replied that I thought the spike proteins in the vaccine helped train immune cells to recognize the virus, and she said yes, but then the immune system can't recognize anything else.

Anyway, her office sent me a message today that the Thymus was in. I wanted to ask here if this is something other chiropractors were aware of and if it could really help with my immune system. I am not sure yet how much it would cost. I also wanted to know if the arm exercise is a real effect, or if there was something else going on.

Chiropractic,"I got my first adjustment Tuesday afternoon, starting a long term plan to visit once a week to help with migraines and my scoliosis. And the adjustment went great I actually laughed and the rest of the day I felt so much better than I had in months. Was able to walk around for more than 2hrs without pain.

The chiropractor warned me that there would be some reactions to the adjustment since it's a new thing and my body might be like what the heck?? The first reaction I had was my neck was a bit hot not bad. The day after the adjustment I had a small headache in the morning which went away and then was suddenly super tired in the mid afternoon like 5 ish I just suddenly was so fatigued I feel asleep for 3hrs and it was a struggle to wake up. Almost fell asleep in the kitchen while waiting for food. But it went away and I was chill. Today(thursday) was a different story. It could be stress that's making it worse as I needed to rush my dog to the vet this morning. But before that I suddenly got HOT like the only times I felt like this before was when my ibs acted up. I was legit nude in the bathroom just eating tums I felt so sick, only lasted a minute or two. I had a small headache which went away, took dog to vet and all chill.

Then the same thing happened around 6ish I was suddenly super exhausted, have a headache worse and fell asleep for about 2 and a half hrs. My back and neck feel hot and I just feel icky. I don't know if it's just because of my migraine as those tend to make me hot in general. And I know worrying and googling is making my anxiety worse.

Chiropractic,"When I opened my practice I always wanted to get involved with the local schools, particularly helping the teachers and staff. I have several family members who work in schools, and I have more intimate details on how they are constantly stressed and overworked. Teachers make great patients, and in my local district they have great chiropractic benefits.

The plan was to set up teacher appreciation days. Now, this is the part you may hate, but you can modify this. I did it a lot when I first started out because I needed to do anything and everything. For the schools I would personally go in and provide 3-4 hours of massages free of charge. You could use terminology like soft tissue work, manual therapy, or whatever, but saying ""massage"" gives certain connotations that people will understand what you are doing. You could go in and do ART or graston clinics if you wanted, I'd just make sure the concept is digestible.

The best way to get in is to contact PTAs. They are the ones responsible for organizing teacher appreciation days, and they are always looking for free options if possible. When you come along offering free massages as part of your ""free community outreach program"", you'll get a lot of bites. They may have a designated person for teacher appreciation, or you may work directly with the PTA president. Either way, this person will be your liaison and connection to the school.

If you can't get a hold of the right person, my next advice is to contact the school secretary. This may be as simple as just calling the school. ""Hi this is Dr K and I was hoping you could give me some advice. I am setting up some free massages for local schools, and I was wondering if you knew who the right person would be to talk to for your school?"" Something like that. More often than not they will start working to schedule you right there, taking down potential dates, or asking a few questions. Secretaries do a lot of computer work and love massages too! Other times they may get me the correct PTA person's phone number, or get me to the principal themselves.

If you want to sweeten the deal you can also cater in food. I try not to make it very expensive, and if there are a lot of staff I generally don't offer (high schools for example). Bringing food does give you a spot to place all sorts of handouts and flyers that everyone can see. I would cater in sandwich platters from Subway, but the prices have probably gone up since then. The variety platters were the best deal versus trying to get individual subs. What I found to be just as appreciated and much cheaper was catering Einstein Bros bagels, again variety packs and variety cream cheeses. Everyone will find something they like, and teachers love the free food.

During the actual massages or soft tissue work, you get to have a nice consult with them. Learn what gives them issues, treat it just like a consult in your office. Then at the end, offer them to come visit you. Maybe you have an incentive if they tentatively sign up while they are with you.

During these events you can get a lot of teachers signed up for new patient exams, and it will make your afternoons very busy when they leave school.

For my school district, I am the guy. I'll still visit schools and drop off goodie bags, but I don't do the massages like I used to. If you are a newer doc trying to brainstorm things to do, this is a great way to spend a morning.",Want to help more teachers? Here is what I did.

Chiropractic," I have a trapped nerve in my neck, self diagnosed but I'm quite sure that's what it is... I think I slept funny 4 nights ago and the sensation goes from being uncomfortable and affecting sleep to being extremely painful and electric type shocks all the way to my index and middle finger. I have still come to the gym (mainly Cardio and core) as wasn't sure if it was something that should be rested or exercised to loosen it up? The pain / sensation has moved from my neck to shoulders and is now chest and Tricep and I have no strength at all in my right arm and it's quite sore. Also my right pec cannot be tensed / is just flaccid.. I am doing a few stretches (chin tuck, wall angels and shoulder blade tucks) which are helping a bit but does this all sound like a trapped nerve, should I be doing (or not doing) anything else or does anyone have any advice as it's exhausting? Thanks in advance...",Trapped nerve?

Chiropractic,"During mid December last year, I was playing a soccer game and went in for a tangle, but extended my left leg laterally, and jamming my hip. I didn't hear a pop or anything like that, so I kept playing on it. After, the side of my hip was very numb and tight and even painful sometimes the rest of the week. Went to physio, he just said that I pulled my hip flexor. Fast forward 3 weeks and I still have the same dull and tight pain on the side of my left hip. Went to another physio and they thought that I might have had a labral tear, so they told me to get an MRI. Got the MRI, and it showed that I had a ""fissure,"" in my labrum. I was told that it was like a partial tear. Immediately physio told me to get PRP which I did not understand. I scheduled an appointment with surgeon to see his opinion. He told me that I should get PRP let alone surgery. He said that my pain was on the left side, and did not show any signs of hip labral tear. He told me to do some PT. PT then told me I had a pelvic tilt, so he spent a couple weeks balancing my pelvis. During my time I felt a decrease in pain, and he told me to start running. Running felt good so after 7 moths almost, I returned to soccer practice. I was told not to do too much too quickly, but after 3 practices of stupid quick turning and excessive shooting, I then started to feel terrible groin pain and pubic pain. This paranoid me because I was reading constantly about how groin pain is associated with labral tear. I kept playing then developed the same pubic and groin pain on my right side, however it was not as painful. I developed osteitis pubis, I was told. Today I'm still doing treatment for the OP, but my main concern now is that my side hip pain has started to come  back really bad, (I always had it but it was very gradual/off-on). My questions are:

1. What was my originally injury?
2. What is causing my side hip pain now?
3. Could my ""fissure"" in my labrum cause all this injury.

Thanks in advance.",Hip Inury
Chiropractic,"I have hernia on my lower back and a problem with my knee. My mom took me to chiropractice and the first thing the chiropractor did was literally take a wooden thing and hit it with huge force on my cervical vertebra. Istg I have never experienced pain like that in my life. My whole body gave out a vibration. The he hit it again. He did the same thing with my already hurting knee.

Now I’m walking with an elastic band on my knee at home (barely walking, I can’t bend my leg) and my neck hurts like a mf. 

Is this normal for chiropractice or should I be concerned? Cause I’m not exaggerating when I say he took a wooden rollling-pin and hit three of my bones with it with full force.",I think chiropractice broke me..

Chiropractic,"Hi everyone I hope my question doesn’t offend anyone. I’m receiving chiropractic care for the first time this week and I was thrown off by how long the treatment plan is. 

Some family members have given me the impression that chiropractors are notorious for unnecessary follow ups and bleeding people dry (financially, not literally). 

Luckily I didn’t have to paid up front for a number of adjustments so I can stop any time I want. 

Is this a big concern in this field? I want to do what’s best for my body and understand that pain relief doesn’t equal healed but my insurance isn’t covering very much so I don’t want to waste money. 

For reference I had a rib subluxation and some phase 1 degeneration in my thoracic and cervical spine and the treatment plan is 6 adjustments over 2 weeks then 12 over 2 months. Is this a normal amount?? 

I appreciate the input :)",Do chiropractors overdo treatment plans?
Chiropractic,"What could explain this? I've been feeling chronically lightheaded for 3 years FYI and I'm only 16, there was literally not a single instance in that time span where I didn't feel lightheaded, there was absolutely no fluctuation to my lightheadedness whatsoever, it was constant.

Not feeling lightheaded after performing those exercises, even for a brief amount of time felt amazing, it was a feeling I've always yearned for after I lost it.

PS: I don't have APT, Kyphosis, or Lumbar Lordosis.

So what could be the issue? Is it a nerve problem or something? Also, there are other symptoms that accompanied my lightheadedness, like my vision getting less 'radiant' and my cognition being significantly impaired.","Lightheadedness briefly goes away when exercising lower body muscles (Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower back)"
Chiropractic,"Not sure if this has been done before in this thread, but I thought it might be helpful for recent and soon-to-be graduates to see how many new patients you established docs get in a typical month.  
So… around how many of your new patient leads actually sign on for care?

Chiropractic,I have a patient who is a workers comp case. She started experiencing pain while lifting at her warehouse job over a year ago and hasn’t been able to shake the pain. I can’t touch her and the only thing we can do is stim. Cervical MRI negative and emg shows long thoracic neuropathy. Any soft tissue techniques I can use? Her pain is just lateral to the spine around c7-t1 level. The Ortho is probably going to recommend therapy or injection. Any recommendations would be helpful,Pt with long thoracic nerve neuropathy
Chiropractic,"Thinking about moving our practice from the Pacific Northwest back to Columbus/surrounding area to be near family. Where I am we’ve whittled our panel participation down to the lowest admin/highest reimbursement payers, and as a clinic heavily favoring rehab, our care model depends on them to be solvent. My concern is that carriers in the Midwest may not be as favorable toward chiropractic as they are here, and we’ll be dealing with UHC/Cigna/Aetna types who pay $14/unit for therapies and come with 1,000 hours of clinical submission/authorization labor. 

Would anyone in the area be willing to provide some insight? 

Thanks!","Columbus, OH docs - what’s the payer landscape like?"
