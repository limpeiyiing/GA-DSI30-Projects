physiotherapy,"Hello. I'm currently a third year Physiotherapy student in Australia. I'm starting to feel a bit confused about my degree and future with Physiotherapy, because I haven't really been enjoying the degree and my grades have been getting much worse. 

I don't really enjoy the practical parts of the course and I'm not that good at them either. I'm better with more theoretical things, and I am also fairly introverted. I still enjoy reading Physio related journal articles and other similar content. 

I'm wondering if I chose the wrong degree. Maybe I should have done a Bachelor of Science or something. It would be a big waste of time to change degrees now though. Someone might suggest getting in to research, but I'm not sure I would be good at or enjoy this either as I tend to find studying quite stressful and I'm not the best with time management. I was hoping to get a job which is relatively low stress so I can enjoy my life for once.

physiotherapy,"Hello Physiotherapists and the like. I just wanted to share a success story. I had a rollerblading accident years ago which caused an anterior pelvic tilt. I had it adjusted by a manual Osteopath, but it didn't seem to stay. I didn't know to also wear a serola belt afterwards. I began to develop postural scoliosis as a result of the anterior pelvic tilt. In the past few years, I noticed my lower eyelid began to droop, and my smile is a bit lopsided. I thought that was caused from a mismatched bite. Not true.

On Friday I went to my new GP with all of my notes from my physiotherapists detailing their plans, and where I ran into hiccups. She explained my right side pelvic tilt and she had me perform a 2 minute corrective stretch. Like a lunge, but my chest pressed forward touching my leg and hands on the ground. Yes, that put me back in place. Yesterday, while sitting up in bed I noticed I can use my lower eyelid. Also my smile feels more natural and less frozen.

physiotherapy,"I'm a second year student (UK), just finished my first placement (had one week observation last year). It was in surgical rehab. I thought placement had been going reasonably well, most of my feedback had been good, generally with some points to work on which I always tried to do. 

I just got my end of placement result and only scored 57%. I was really disappointed with this as the marking scheme basically says anyone who is ""okay"" at treatment, assesment, communication etc falls into this bracket.

One of the placement module leaders at my university says the mean mark for clinical placement is 58-62. I highly doubt this is true.

She checked me over and said I have hypomobile L4/L5 facet joints and ever so slight anterior pelvic tilt and was given an exercise plan consisting of lumbar and thoracic side flexion, pelvic tilt standing, glute stretch supine but was not told when to stop or when to make a following appointment.

3. Are salaries really that bad? Would it be more worthwhile to just stick at a job and work my way up through a company? 

4. What are career growth opportunities like over read a lot about there being a low ceiling once you‚Äôve graduated? This isn‚Äôt a problem for me as I‚Äôm not just in it for the money but would obviously like to upskill and progress throughout my career. 

5. Is there anything you wish you knew before going down the career path of a PT? Would love just some general advice around the career to help me make my decision. 

Sorry for the long read - I have been lurking this sub for a while now and I really can‚Äôt seem to figure out if this is going to be the right decision for me.

For example, a 24 year old female patient walks in presenting lower right deep aching back pain they‚Äôve had for 2 months, beginning when they were sitting in a car. After the first week of low back pain, the pain begins extending to their right buttock, pain increases after sitting. They are given an exercise plan for stiff L4/L5 facet joint including: 

Lumbar and Thoracic side flexion standing

Pelvic tilt | Pelvic Tuck Standing 

Glute Stretch Supine

physiotherapy,"I keep reading that after total knee replacement MUA, the doctor can get your bend to something like 120-130 and then when they go into PT that same day, the bend on your own can be less like 100 (but it may eventually get to 120).  I originally thought this might be because of scar tissue, but I just watched a video by a PT that said there's no way that in a matter of hours scar tissue has formed and that ""something is missing"" from the understanding here.  Then I did a quick google and yeah, scar tissue doesn't form in hours apparently.  Does anyone have any guess as to why this occurs?  The PT in the video made it seem like your body just has a instinctual reaction of some sort, although it didn't seem clear.",After TKR MUA I've read that ROM can drop significantly from where doctor can get it even that same day?

physiotherapy,"I just had a pre employment functional capacity test in Qld with a physio.

At the end the physio noticed some 15 year old (I am 31 and I advised this happened at 14) self harm scars on my arm and insisted this go on the report to my future employer.

Is this right? Nobody has asked me about these scars in about 15 years. I have had several pre employment medicals including for working overseas. What the hell do ancient self harm scars have to do why my capacity to perform tasks at a regional council?

Anyway I'm not going to press this or anything just wondered if any physios have experience with these types of tests and if that's normal?

Layman here who doesn't know much about physiotherapy. I was diagnosed with cervicular radiculopathy a couple of years ago. The physiotherapist eventually started cupping therapy which I was a little skeptical about (and I didn't feel it was helping either, to be honest). Then the pandemic started and I moved to my hometown and stopped the treatment. 

So, my question is whether cupping therapy is considered a legitimate procedure? If not, should I ever go back to that physiotherapist again or avoid any such professionals who follow such treatment procedures?",Is cupping therapy considered a legitimate treatment procedure among physiotherapists?

physiotherapy,"Heyall, currently in my third year out of university in Australia and have always done part time Private Practice and Community Disability Work at two separate employers.

physiotherapy,"How do PTs feel about pushing their patients (specifically children) into pain during sessions to gain range of motion during therapy - bearing in mind pts are already stretched through full range while in exposures on ketamine every few days, and no ROM restrictions noted during exposures. 

As a clinician, I do expect there to be some pain during transitional movements, sustained movements etc. But at what point do we clinically decide that we are causing too much pain? Where is the line? On the flip side - how do we know whether or not we are pushing hard enough?

physiotherapy,"So I'll preface this with some details.  I am a 40 year old Canadian male in western Canada.  I have been diagnosed with central sensitivity / fibromyalgia for about four years now.  I take a ton of neuropathic pain pills and cannabis to get by day to day, and had pretty much resigned myself to being trapped in a downhill marriage with nothing but pain to look forward to.

Cue the physio , first week I am shown how to re 'enlist' my core muscles to help mitigate some lower back pain.  Over the span of the next two visits and adding more stretching and flexing, I felt a series of squish-click-pops and my lower lumbar pain went from a 9 to a 2.  And has stayed there.

So suffice to say I am now hooked on PT and have immense and complex feelings of gratitude for my PT enabling me to better myself.

But... Now that I am improving, I have to go back and deal with the mountain of stuff that was displaced by my severe recent pain.  Like taking the pin out of a seperated-ing (cohabiting coparents due to COVID and kids and finances) marriage.  And as I contemplate that process, I realized I was really really wanting to ask my PT out for coffee.  She is likely a solid ten years my junior, way out of my league, and has zero reason to not already be in a relationship.  But I still can't shake the thought, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to follow through sooner than later, despite the complications in my life.  If there's one thing CSS has taught is not not procrastinate the really important things that I may lose the ability to do again later.

So on a scale of one to creep, how bad of an idea is it to simply ask my PT if she'd like to have coffee with me some time?  Am I just going to fuck up a therepeutic relationship by doing so?",developing an intense crush on my physiotherapist
