physiotherapy,"Hi Physios!   
I am a 3rd year student in the Netherlands, trying to find a topic for my literature review and graduation project, and I thought about Vestibular therapy for Peripheral Vestibular Hypofunction in the elderly to improve the symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and disequilibrium. 

my question is, in your country, do you have to be a certified vestibular therapist to apply the vestibular treatment? can I do an internship in my 4th year and apply the therapy without an additional course?  

I am thinking to do my internship in Canada/England/Israel. so if you can give me information regarding those countries and vestibular therapy, that's would be amazing.

* Reducing acquired flatfeet which are contributing to ankle and knee pain
* plantar fasciitis

Once you've addressed the more proximal joints, the research and general attitudes towards towards ankle strength (I'm ignoring mobility issues here) are a bit vague except that there is an intense focus on tibialis posterior activation and strength.

The rationale of course being that a) medial collapse is caused by pronation so we should do the opposite of that and b) tib post **supports the arch of the foot.**

Point b) never made sense to me. Anatomically speaking, the tib post tendon doesn't *traverse* the arch but I'll concede that if off-loads it a bit.

Meanwhile my instructors and the research in general don't say much about fibularis strength which is bizarre since the tendon of fibularis longus *does* cross the arch; it's also a thicker tendon.

So a little back story about me is I recently graduated from a Kinesiology program in Ontario and was really hoping I’d get into a PT program here after graduating. My grades however were not so great, which made it impossible for me to be accepted at any of the programs in Canada as they are very competitive. So I’ve been looking at programs abroad (mainly the UK, Australia, NZ, and Ireland) but I had no luck with the masters programs in the UK and was told Australia would be similar.

physiotherapy,"Recently just commenced at a new placement in an acute cardiorespiratory context and have encountered a difficult scenario involving my CE during my first week and I'm looking for advice. Note it is my first time working in this context.

Essentially, I was due to assess and administer treatment of a patient with tuberculosis, for the first time. The patient was in an isolation room with full PPE precautions required. 

Prior to visiting the patient and with my assessment and treatment plan prepared, I asked if I required supervision with this patient. There were many attachments that I'd need to disconnect to mobilise patient that I was encountering in practice for the first time. Similarly, I also wanted to ensure I was following correct infection control procedures. 

At the time, my supervisor said I didn't require supervision with the patient. So, I visited the patient independently and with the assistance of the nurse donned PPE and administered treatment. I had to figure out the attachments myself, and luckily it was not too complex. However, I felt somewhat uncomfortable treating in this context without supervision.

A few hours after treating the patient, I was called into my supervisors office and interrogated. Basically asked why I was unsupervised when treating patient. When I told him I asked a nurse for assistance he asked me for specific information on which nurse it was.

I found the entire situation confusing and stressful, considering he confirmed that it was fine in the first instance after I specifically asked. And that none of the other clinicians, who I actually handover to immediately prior to seeing the patient deemed that I should be supervised.

Overall, I feel the situation has jeopardised my placement and caused considerable stress and I'm unsure how best to proceed.","Confusing situation on placement, advice needed? (Australia)"

physiotherapy,"After an exchange that got pretty nasty with a user who claimed he wasn't diagnosing a patient and yet another one this morning who even came up with 4 possible diagnoses we want to clarify what we understand by the term.

As soon as a poster gives an answer like

* It could be a torn &lt;whatever&gt; but ask your physio
* It is a tight &lt;whatever&gt;
* You probably have a damaged &lt;whatever&gt;
* I suspect it to be &lt;whatever&gt;
* You have &lt;whatever&gt; but it could also be &lt;whatever&gt;
* Tell your physio to look at your &lt;whatever&gt; because it could be &lt;whatever&gt;

 **you are diagnosing.**

There are more examples but these are the ones that pop up a couple times a week. Most of you won't see them because they're gone ASAP.

There are a couple reasons why we are so vehemently against it. It is not only because it is highly unethical to diagnose a patient without seeing him/her in real life. A second, similarly important reason is that once you have put something in someone's head it is pretty much impossible to get it out again. How would you like it when your patient would tell you ""Yeah, you could be right but these guys on reddit told me it was &lt;whatever&gt;"". 

And then there is the reason, albeit of less importance IMHO, that we al have worked hard to get our degrees and why should we offer advice for free?

Ofcourse a colleague could be wrong and sometimes a second opinion can be helpful. In our opion the downsides are more important.

Posters who proffer diagnoses and/or advice in a vague way get way with a slap on the wrist and their post is removed. More obvious ""offenders"" get a 30 day ban. Recidivists get a permanent ban. 

Obviously not-so-serious remarks like

* your chacra is out of line
* you dislodged your aura
* stop wearing red T-shirts
* have you looked at the color of your morning pipi

will not be sanctioned. Allthough, erm, some patients may even take these serious.

All that being said, Reddit has changed the rules about giving medical advice some time ago. It is now not generally forbidden to do so and moderators can define their own rules. We hope we have been able to clarify a frew things as to why we won't have it on this sub.

physiotherapy,"I understand i might be breaking a rule of this subreddit. Im sorry but I’m desperate. If you could dm that would work.

Hello everyone , i come here today because after three physical therapy sessions i feel as though my physical therapist may not know exactly what he is talking about or is not taking me seriously. Additionally, i am a bit desperate.

Six years ago i rolled my ankle when i stepped into a hole on the field while at practice. I couldn’t walk for two days without pain and the front of my ankle was swollen. I was 17 at the time and had been lifting weights in bodybuilding fashion for a few years. Maybe two months afterward i noticed the calf on the injured ankle had atrophied significantly like ALOT and i was no longer getting pumps in that calf as opposed to my other calf muscle which functions normally and was a great deal larger. I figured it would return to normal on its own eventually and i had other life events sidetrack my life in the gym to the point where i stopped working out completely.

I am now 23 and upon my return to the gym over a year ago i still cannot feel the calf muscle on that leg and it remains smaller than my other calf. I don’t believe it is not a mind-muscle thing because i do not even feel a stretch in the left calf muscle when i stand on ledge while i do feel it in my right calf and I’ve tried doing single leg calf exercises. I also notice some overdevelopment on the outside of my calf while the main muscle that forms the bulk of it remains unresponsive no matter what. I can still flex the calf on the injured side but i do not get the tight cramping feeling i would get prior to my injury.

I went to see an orthopedic as i thought i might have a dislocated ankle and he took some x rays but found nothing wrong. My insurance declined to pay for a MRI.

Additionally my injured ankle pops a lot and in a more forceful manner than my other ankle and is quite loud. My physical therapist who I’ve been seeing for two weeks gave me some daily home exercises and a band such as dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion. 

When i got for my visits he has me do some balancing exercises and calf raises and continually asks me if i feel the muscle but i do not. 

Today he tells me that there is not much they can do for nerve damage contradicting what he said previously about trying an EMS machine. Also tells me that I’m not eating enough protein and gives me basic workout information I’ve known since i was 13. This made me really lose some faith him.

I’ve had other injuries including a torn shoulder but nothing that i couldn’t move past like this.

I just want to know if anyone here has seen anything similar to this and could help me or tell me what to do as I’m quite frustrated and just want to get things back to normal where i can get back to bodybuilding.

Sorry if this was but long but i wanted to give as many details as possible.

physiotherapy,"Hi there,

4th year undergraduate in Singapore and I'm currently in placement. There's this new school policy for allied health students in placements which says that for students who fail 2 consecutive placements, the student will be asked to drop out of the course (that is to ""maintain the standards of \[the university's\] graduates""). Unfortunately I'm stuck at this choice point now and thinking whether I should  appeal to the examiners' board to repeat my MSK placement a 3rd time or to just drop out. 

In the first MSK placement I didn't start it with the right headspace - I didn't think I had good foundations because I didn't do well at all for the past 3 years which have been a struggle. I scraped through my practical exams as I have performance anxiety, and I'm currently seeing a counsellor to manage it. Staying back till late to plan for the following day's cases also took a toll on my physical and mental health. Couple that with poor confidence and low self-esteem, when I was unable to perform during my cases I just spiralled. I cried 4 times in front of my work mentor for 4 weeks and was miserable and tardy in general.

I was more in control and could manage my mental health better in the 2nd placement, so that was where my difficulties with the clinical skills were more apparent. Because I was caught up with wanting to do things right rather than safe, I tend to zoom in on what I want to observe and I fail to widen the lens and see what's around me. For instance, I would usually stand at a distance to observe my patient's gait, but you should at least be at a standby assistance level if the patient's gait is unstable.

Another reason is that I have difficulty modifying my assessments and treatments to my patients' needs on the fly. I find that difficult to plan for or predict, and the possibilities can be endless. Many times I had to scrap my plans for my review knee patients as they would present with acute flare-ups, or find that their main concern is now their back pain.

I have been asking my closer friends for their perspectives and most of them agree that I should toughen it out and complete the degree. My fourth year is only less than 9 months. However I found that the past 3 years have been a struggle - I couldn't find anything which I really excelled in (anatomy was REALLY challenging because I coudn't memorise well), I didn't really ""enjoy"" what I learned and my GPA is less than a 3. The main reason I joined physiotherapy was because I wanted a career that could impact the lives of others meaningfully. But it is also true that I can also do the same in other professions.

I  just feel that things would only go uphill from here should I be successful in my appeal- I am behind my peers 3 months, would be juggling with 2 thesis (1 group and 1 4.5k individual)  papers, and I must not fail my remaining 3 placements (MSK is my 2nd of 5 placements). At this rate I'm not sure if I can graduate with my peers on time; I will know more once the head of programme emails me regarding the next actions to take. My friend says I should just tackle things one at a time, but it's demoralising to know that even though I have put my best foot in it wasn't enough for me to make it through and I'm just tired. If I do decide to drop out, I do have backup plans to venture into F&amp;B, which is something that excites me.

Private clinic contracter - starts with 50/50 split for new grads - if busy can make 100k+ a year.

Private clinic hourly - Starts 35 - 40hr. Can get up to 45/hr - you get paid if you see 5 patients or 15 patients in a day. You also get paid time off, vacation and benefits as you are an employee of the clinic and not considered a contracter. 

Working in hospital - Starting 34 - 37/hr depending on province. Can get up to 44 - 48/hr depending on time and experience.

Any info or advice is greatly appreciated!",What's it like juggling private practice and hospital work as a new-grad?

physiotherapy,"Hi, I have a question about language learning. I posted maybe something similar, but still have some questions cause I accidentally deleted the thread.

Currently I live in Croatia. Right now going into my last year of Bachelor degree, planning to do a Master's degree after Bachelor also. 

My English is at C2 level, I have a certificate following CEFR standards. I'm also starting to learn German from A2 level this fall. Planning to get my German to B2 level. 

Now I wanna know how much does it help with job finding and employment, to have these language certificates?

Will it be a lot, lot easier to find a job or it's still gonna be a pain in the ass?

My big goal is to work in some professional sports (football club, basketball etc.) outside.

 A smaller goal first is to get a good base of knowledge, experience( already volunteering in professional football club) and I guess language while I'm still a student. 

I am of course willing to work first in some clinic or rehab center but would like to push myself and get into sports somewhere out there. How much does language help with that?

Thanks for answering my question.",Language learning

I've been doing my Google's and found out that one can become a physiotherapist even if they don't have a science degree, but with a degree in anything. The catch is that they must take the prerequisite courses and get a certain avg in these courses. On top of that, they must have a certain sub gpa.

physiotherapy,"I have a kid who is starting tackle football this week. He will be playing blind side tackle on the O-Line and defensive end on the D-Line. Since these are not ""skill positions"" like running back and wide receiver, that need to do a LOT of cutting movements, I was wondering if it would be wise to do a small tape job as a preventative measure. Lineman are constantly pushing each other off balance and there is a small but reasonable expectation that you might have someone crash into your legs/ankles while you're focused elsewhere.

At the same time, my kid is 11, so he's basically made of rubber and can bounce back very quickly. 

disclaimer: I have never played american football, but was a competitive soccer player. Taping my ankles was out of the question as a midfielder who needed all the range of motion I could get.

physiotherapy,"Hey guys,

I'm 27 from the UK and am wondering if anyone can give me any tips or recommendations where to start to get into sports physiotherapy?

A bit of background about myself. I have no prior knowledge of the profession but have been athletic all of my adult life. I am a 9+ year BJJ practitioner and have also been doing CrossFit for a number of years, I have been to a number of different physio over the years for injuries or to improve movement and have always been fascinated by their knowledge, and have always wondered whether it could be an interesting career path for myself. Unfortunately all of my qualifications are related to my current career which is nothing to do with sport. 

I am fully aware I would eventually need to take a full degree, however at the moment it's still just an idea. So I was wondering if there is anything you could recommend for.me to dabble in to see if it's really for me. Any small time courses maybe, books? Whatever 🙂. As I am ofcourse reluctant to spend thousands and years to change careers if I'm not 100% sure it's right for me.

I was diagnosed with tension headache.Just yesterday I realised that is coming from my neck since I've tried a lot of meds nothing was helping much apart from ibuprofen I found this guy on the internet since I started doing this exercise(chin tuck) I started feeling immediate results it was improving (buy the way I have this tension headache for 8th months now),but the problem is that when I was doing this exercise yesterday (I did 3 or four times during the day) with the last I was golding this ""chin tuck"" until I counted to 200 my blood pressure went insanely high and I start having tinnitus.

My blood pressure is a bit high 95 over 155 but it went extremely high after this exercise.

Could you tell me can I do this exercise everyday??(If I am having this high blood pressure issue)

And wat is the safe ""hold"" period (obviously I was doing more than this guy is recommending in the video)

Looking for some advice(as this is helping) but need more advice how to keep going with the exercise but not to affect blood pressure( how long to hold and how many repetition and how many times a day???)

It also reduces my blood pressure if I am not overdoing it.

Is it possible that I have discopathia(or is it possible that stiff neck can bring blood pressure up) that is bringing my blood pressure up and causing headache???

Right now I'm in my last year of Bachelor's degree in physiotherapy. I'm planning on also finishing Master's degree right after my bachelor's. 

During these three years of Bachelor's degree i finished a number of courses like dry needling, Cyriax A + B, sports massage, myofascial relaxation etc. Also I went for three weeks to work in nursing home in Portugal during high school because of Erasmus.

Right now, I'm volunteering as a physio in a professional football club in 2nd league for about 9 months now. 

My English is at C1-C2 level, and I'm about to start learning German from A1. So, you can see I'm investing heavily in myself and I plan to continue doing during Master's degree.

Now in Croatia to obtain our license we need to do a year of internship which is really hard to get because there are very few openings. Like some people wait over two years to get it.

But you can do a internship outside in Europe if a clinic or some institution is willing to take you. I plan on finding some place outside of Croatia for that after my master's.
