physiotherapy,"I went into university (kinesiology) thinking that this would lead me to become a physical therapist. I am currently in my first year and many of the people I have met have told me the same. I realize that this is an extremely competitive occupation, and with my low work ethic, I am unsure if it will be possible for me to become one in the long run. My first semester I got an A- in every class. I felt that this was around the best I could do with the amount of work I would want to put in. If I continued like this, with the occasional volunteering and working, would I have a substantial chance at becoming a physiotherapist?

I have considered switching majors or taking a gap year because kinesiology doesn't seem to be well respected or lead to many jobs outside of physio.

As you can probably tell, I haven't talked to many people about career advice.

physiotherapy,"I have a dream, and am at a crossroads in deciding on a career. BEFORE I seriously jump in with both feet feet physiotherapy (which yes, I would be passionate about), I need to say: That dream is to become a successful and financially free entrepreneur and investor, making a positive difference in the world.

That said, I need some reality checks... Give it to me straight, what - from your industry experience and knowledge - makes the below goal either realistic or unrealistic? Thanks all in advance. üôè 

Imagine the career route:

‚Ä¢ Study and get qualified
‚Ä¢ Gain experience 
‚Ä¢ Start a clinic and transition to self-employment
‚Ä¢ Focus on marketing and content creation via YouTube, Podcasts, and a Website, and specialise in a niche (such as Sports Physiotherapy)
‚Ä¢ Hire other PT's to reduce business' dependence on your presence / hourly services
‚Ä¢ Also outsource content creation administration and ""grime"" work
‚Ä¢ Take the CEO role and expand, opening other clinics, hiring more, or even offering mobile services with more employees to increase reach and client base
‚Ä¢ Now, I own a growing (one day big) business, and can focus on the bigger picture. The business doesn't NEED me - the managers and employed staff handle the running of the business, and I guide it and make sure the cash flow is positive. Thus, financial freedom has been achieved from the business income and from wise investments (property, crypto, funds, etc.)...

Hard work and learning are no-brainers here. It's a competitive and changing world, but seemingly it's also one demanding more physio's.

So, have you ever seen the entrepreneurial physio route work? Have you attempted it? Any suggestions?

Hopefully someone is willing to help a young soul out. This isn't my only idea, but it's not the worst either haha. üôÇ",Physio Entrepreneurs - Is the Dream Realistic?

physiotherapy,"Hi everyone, a little background on myself, some general life story spiel and perspective on my situation in the first 2 paragraphs; if you're not interested skip to the third paragraph for the meat of my question!

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 24, finished year 12 however didn't get an ATAR because I didn't complete the required number of units for one, I took the bare minimum amount of classes in year 11/12 and picked stupid subjects like history and retail studies instead of math and science. Unfortunately as an immature kid with no father figure around and no discipline from my mum I slacked hard and took the path of least resistance. I was the kind of student who got reports every year along the lines of ""Bright/Intelligent but talks too much/needs to focus more..."" I live in an immense amount of regret and shame from my incompetence at school and have yearned desperately to rectify that in adulthood.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea what I wanted to do for work when I graduated so I just followed the easy money and went into warehouse work not long after graduating and spent the last 6 or so years doing that. About 2 years in I busted my back up quite badly doing manual labour and went to see a private practice physiotherapy clinic about it for a few months. This is when I realised I may of found my calling for life, I loved going there, I loved the vibe of the clinic, I thought that the people there had such an awesome job. I absorbed all the knowledge they imparted on me in my recovery plan and still incorporate a lot of their stretches and exercises in my daily routine. It led me to look into the ""how"" and ""why"" of exercising, stretching and injury management/prevention and develop an interest in science backed practice. I'm a very active and health conscious individual outside of work, practically live in the gym. The staff in that clinic seemed like \*my\* people if that makes sense, obviously a lot better educated then me at that! Unfortunately due to low self esteem and guilt over my terrible academic performance I didn't look into this career change until last year, however the thought of doing physio never left my mind over all this time which I believe is important.

&amp;#x200B;

 I decided to take a risk this year and quit my full time warehouse job to pursue my dream of becoming a physio. These are the steps in my pathway;

 1. TAFE - doing a Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance with Physiotherapy specialisation. My idea is through doing this certificate, I gain relevant industry experience and ideally ongoing part time or casual employment as a physiotherapy assistant to pay the bills through uni. I also hope that this will make me more attractive to hire as a physiotherapist assistant in the first place then a bachelor of physio student fresh out of school with no work experience as the TAFE certificate comes with 3 weeks of work placement with NSW health which leads to ongoing employment for most students post study.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Uni - I will then do the Western Sydney University integrated diploma to bachelor of health science degree as it's my local Uni and has no ATAR requirement. I aim to get excellent grades to allow me to perform an internal transfer to the bachelor of physiotherapy in my second year. If I do not achieve the required grades to transfer in my bachelor's I will complete my bachelor of health science with clinical sciences as my major which will allow me to do a postgraduate masters of physiotherapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this realistic for someone who did not get an ATAR? I realise that the bachelors of physiotherapy has one of the highest ATAR requirements out of all bachelor degrees in Australia but this is the \*only\* career in life I have ever had any passion and drive to chase. If it's impossible to become a physio without an ATAR I would appreciate being suggested some alternate career avenues that scratch the same itch or the best way to re-do my ATAR and get it high enough to do physiotherapy. I want to go to university and receive a proper education.

Thank you so much for reading my wall of text and for any pertinent information, encouragement and or constructive criticism/feedback you can offer.

physiotherapy,"Last year I began running, but as I slipped on a icey road while running (without falling) something happened in my patella tendon where it hurt every time I walked downhill. The pain hasn‚Äôt been bothering me to the point where I have seemed help, it‚Äôs just kind of been there.

But.. Then I was at the gym 1.5 weeks ago approximately, and I wanted to test out the individual strength in each leg as I have imbalances due to bulging disc in my lower back, and my physio recommended that I tried testing out the difference in my muscle strength in leg press.

So, I did that. I have done 150-170kg for reps before (with both legs) and have trained for a long time consistently, so I thought 70kg would be challenging but possible. However, as tested my weak leg (and bad knee side) it was like something snapped and hurt instantly. 

Since then, I have had pain moving around the patella cap. This is in my left leg btw. It started at the bottom right, then the pain was at the left top a couple of days after, and finally today it is at the bottom right and top right. 

I can‚Äôt find anything on Google, but I would like to find some rehab exercises to try out while waiting for physio referral, but I would like to have a direction as to what might be wrong before doing some exercises that might cause more harm than good.

Can anybody help?",Does anybody have any idea what my knee pain might indicate?

But.. I have a patient every half hour/hour depending on the case. No time in between. A self-paid 30 min break during the day, where in my country - Denmark - it's the norm to have a paid break. The schedule is not the best, and different everyday which is hard for me.. I can live with it (e.g only 12 hours between a shift 1 day/week). I use 1,5 hours driving every day in tight traffic (45 min each way). Other small details I'm not pleased with - expecting to be there 20 min before opening hour two days/week to turn on light and stuff, without pay.

physiotherapy,"Hello!

I am a physiotherapy student from Norway in the process of writing my bachelor thesis.   
I have chosen to compare high frequency/volume with low frequency/volume in patients with subacromial pain (shoulder impingement). As of now I have only found 1 study that explicitly tries to research this:  

* √òster√•s, H., Torstensen, T. A., Haugerud, L., &amp; √òster√•s, B. S. (2009). *Dose‚Äìresponse effects of graded therapeutic exercises in patients with long-standing subacromial pain. Advances in Physiotherapy*

I have found other studies which has a high volume and high frequency, such as:

* Holmgren, T., Bjornsson Hallgren, H., Oberg, B., Adolfsson, L., &amp; Johansson, K. (2012). *Effect of specific exercise strategy on need for surgery in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome* 

While this trial has high load and high frequency (with good results), the focus on this study is comparing specific movements with unspecific movements. As both protocol has a high frequency. 

Both of these studies are included in a systemic review from 2020 by C. Littlewood and friends:

*  Malliaras, P., Johnston, R., Street, G., Littlewood, C., Bennell, K., Haines, T., &amp; Buchbinder, R. (2020). *The efficacy of higher versus lower dose exercise in rotator cuff tendinopathy: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials* 

And while it concludes with a mix of uncertainty and positivity, it states that more research is needed. 

However I am having difficulties find more literature on the subject. I was wondering if anyone knew of any studies that examines this problem? Also, if anyone got a lot of clinical experience trying different approaches I would also be interested in hearing your personal experiences.

physiotherapy,"In university as well as in clinical practice (in Australia at least), we were taught that gait aids play an important role in preventing falls. During my clinics, it is standard protocol that we always place the patient's gait aid within reach. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting that older people who use gait aids actually has a higher falls risk than those who don't. 

So if we prescribe a gait aid to someone who we deem is high falls risk, wouldn't we inadvertently put them at an even higher risk? I understand the reasoning behind it (increase BOS, stability etc.), but the evidence doesn't seem to support it at all, so why give it in the first place? There's even evidence to support the hypothesis that using a gait aid impedes compensatory movements and increases task complexity (particularly relevant to those who are cognitively impaired).

That's not to say gait aids are useless though, I think they definitely have their place (e.g. offloading weight, endurance purposes), but to prescribe someone a gait aid on the basis of preventing falls seems to go against the evidence.

physiotherapy,"Im looking for physios advice relating to the financial aspects of the field
I am a M23yo working as an acoustic engineer in Sydney. I have been working in this role for 1.5 years now (weird story but it started as work experience while i completed my bachelor of science). I quickly realised that the pay was quite generous, I started on 50k per year and received pay rises approximately every 6 months, the last one being September last year where I was raised to 80k (before tax and super). 

I have always desired a career in health and physio seems to fit my strengths and interests as well as having a good work-life balance. I have been accepted into the doctor of physiology masters degree at Macquarie university starting mid this year. However, after researching salaries for physios and comparing it to what I am earning now/possibly earning in the future, it is hard to commit to 3 more years of uni, only to come out the other end to earn less. Also considering what my salary could be like at my work in 3 years time.

Although I definitely dont hate it, I know that acoustic engineering is far from where I would like to spend most of my working years, although my current mindset is quite money motivated. 

I guess my questions are:
1. From a physios perspective, is a career in this field worth swapping from a job with a higher salary and going back to uni?
2. I understand it is possible, but how difficult/likely is it to reach 100k and above in this field?
3. Any advice for a person in my position?

Thanks","Currently earning 80k per year as an engineer and considering starting a masters degree in physio, is it worth changing careers?"

Bit of background, I have been working as a dietitian for a year now (graduated 2020) with master nutrition and dietetics. Unfortunately, the career is not stable and there seems to be a lack of progression in the private sector. Fortunately, though I have a bachelor's in exercise and sports science so I can do a master's of physio if I wanted to. 

People are telling me that doing exercise physiology would better complement my dietetics work rather than physio. 

Would anyone have advice with regards to going from dietitian to physio? or would it be better to do Exercise physiology and combine that with my dietitian work, so I can provide both exercise and nutrition advice.

physiotherapy,"(Please note that I'm asking if this **could** happen, every patient is different etc, etc,)

A lot of what I've been taught and read about treating ITB syndrome is somewhat anecdotal or moderate-quality evidence at best.

One thing that never seems to get brought up is the possibility that **weak quads could contribute to a symptomatically tight ITB.** The emphasis is always on glutes and core and quads are ONLY brought up under the presumption that they're tight.

I've never liked this idea of having tunnel-vision towards one particular muscle or demonising another and so it's frustrating when nobody has even tried to assess if quad weakness is involved. Consider this:

* The ITBH helps maintain lateral knee stability. If the quads are weak the knees will buckle slightly during weight-bearing. When the knee buckles, it's more likely to do so by rotating inward due to the centre of gravity being  medial to the knee. This pulls on the ITB and over time would irritate it.

It's just a hypothesis but I can't find any research or even expert opinion acknowledging it.

Does anybody have any experience with this? Critiques? Maybe some good studies to read?

All help is appreciated :)",Could weak (*not* tight) quads contribute to tight ITB issues?

physiotherapy,"Hi I went to a physiotherapist on Friday because my back starting hurting after I spent a lot of time shoveling. The therapist diagnosed me with mechanical low back pain and said I had to attend a minimal of 2 times a week for 8 weeks and that after 8 weeks I would likely just need 1 time a week for 2 weeks to make sure everything in my back was normal.

It is true that any so-called ‚Äúsupport,‚Äù by taking over the natural role of muscle and connective tissue, will weaken your foot and ankle and this can, over time, lead to injuries. 

Arch support will weaken the foot muscles and prevent them from naturally absorbing shocks while walking or running. A tight and overbuilt high-top will do the same to your ankle.
