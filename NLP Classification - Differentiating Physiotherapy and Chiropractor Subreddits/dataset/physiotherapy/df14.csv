physiotherapy,"Exercise:

Sit on a char with the legs at 90\* to the floor. 

Externally rotate the knee by turning the foot outwards, but don't flare out the knees, keep them parallel to one another.

That to flex the leg back towards your centre, whilst keeping your muscles under tension. Move the leg back and forward a couple of inches a few times, switching between flexion and extension.

Pain may be felt just above the kneecap but to the right. Pain may also be felt in the dip between the kneecap and the point where the IT band inserts. 

Is this the patellar tendon and a sign of PFPS? Or the meniscus? Or something else entirely?

physiotherapy,"Hello.

I‚Äôve been having back problems for a while but now it‚Äôs just getting too much for me. I have a lot of dull, sometimes sharp and burning sensations in my lower, mid and upper back, sometimes in my neck. All the pain is right by my spine.

physiotherapy,"Was performing oropharyngeal suctioning today for a patient with a NGT. On the last set, I noticed that a portion of the NGT was in the mouth (only the mid portion of the tube, not the end tip). Subsequently the patient swallowed it back. Had to alert the nursing staff to review the placement of the NGT.

Qn1: i suspect it is likely due to the strong cough reflex elicited during suctioning. Was wondering whether it is a common occurrence for the NGT be regurgitated  during suctioning? 

Qn2: Moving forward, how can I prevent this unfortunate event from happening again?

physiotherapy,"Hello everyone!

I‚Äôm an American looking to do a MSc in the UK! While I‚Äôm not planning on attending for about 2 years to continue to save money, I may need to take a small student loan out (less then $10,000 at most). Apparently Federal Student loans here in America can only be used towards foreign programs that do not involved a heavy placement curriculum (can‚Äôt be more than 25% of the credits). 

I know physiotherapy programs do involve some placements, but how much placement is it? 

I have reached out to some of the schools international advisors for help, but I haven‚Äôt been contacted quite yet. 

Would it be better to apply for a private loan instead, or attend a less prestigious/connected university that I can pay without loans?

Edit: Also, Is there a way to possibly only get aid for the first year, as it is mostly classes rather than placements? Or do they look at your whole course? I‚Äôve never used student loans before.",US to UK: MSc Physio Question

physiotherapy,"I am currently applying for Recognition of International Qualification.
I have filled the necessary application and my University has also submitted the required information about my course.
However CORU is constantly asking for corrections or amendments in the practice placement table after I make the requested changes, things that are never clearly described in their website application process.

I have been to and fro with them on the phone (*they take weeks to reply via email) but their description are always often vague or too generalised.

Can someone point me to a good resource or a sample application that was accepted that I can send my university as a reference to make ammendments so as to meet CORU's standards?

physiotherapy,"Hi everyone,

Canadian postgrad student here, recently received offers into the Masters of  Physiotherapy programs at University of Sydney and University of Queensland. I‚Äôve researched a bit about  the schools/city but would like some more insight on the physiotherapy  programs offered by these schools specifically. I have a BKin background so hopefully that helps with keeping up with the material as I've heard for the postgrad program it's quite intensive right off the bat. 

The two big considerations I've boiled it down to so far are overall quality of the program (student satisfaction, placement opportunities etc) and living in Sydney vs. Brisbane. It‚Äôs been tough trying  to decide between the two, and I feel a bit pressured to decide soon  with the rolling admissions and all. I've only got 2 weeks to accept UQ's offer and begin online learning this November. For Usyd, there's a possibility it will be in class learning for the February 2022 intake. 

I would love to hear from current or former students in the program, international or not. As well as physios currently practising in Australia who took a similar route. I posted in the uni subs but haven't gotten much of a response so your input here is greatly appreciated! Cheers",Masters of Physio at Usyd or UQ - any advice?

physiotherapy,"Hello all,
I am in the last months of my studies to become a physiotherapist in Germany and I have a question that I have not found an answer to for a long time:
What happens when a joint cracks? I have heard several theories whose answer had to do with adhesion forces, which sounds kind of logical but doesn't really satisfy me.
Is there a scientific answer to this question?
Subsequent to this question is, of course, whether cracking is healthy or unhealthy....

physiotherapy,"Hi! I‚Äôm am a Canadian current psych undergrad who has decided to switch gears and pursue a masters in physiotherapy. I am about to go into my final year, and asides from finishing the anatomy and physiology prerequisites, I have every other academic requirement fulfilled. My subgpa at the current moment in time is a 3.93, however of course this is not including what my GPA will be in upcoming the fall semester.

However, because this is a recent change in direction, I don‚Äôt have as much relevant  volunteering experience as I would like. I have a lot of extracurriculars, but they aren‚Äôt specifically pertaining to PT. I do volunteer with elderly folk, however it is a mental health volunteering position rather than a physical health one. I have not volunteered in a hospital before.

My question is, would I still have a shot? I am going to try and apply to volunteer at a hospital in the fall, however I am doubtful I‚Äôll be able to get a specifically PT volunteering position, as those have been of short supply recently. I suppose my second question is, would it perhaps be better for me to take a year off, and then volunteer in that year off to better my chances?

physiotherapy,"Hi All,

So recently I quit my degree in my final year. I had 3x5 week placements left to complete to get my degree, however due to compounding anxiety issues (avoidance, panic episodes etc.) that made progression and any level of pt care impossible, I decided to withdraw from my course. The issues affected me significantly through my 3rd year and I missed about 90% of my main practicals because of it, but somehow I managed to pass my practical exams and never failed anything. 

Consequently, I lack many of the requisite skills to pass placements, particularly in the neuro and acute care settings and my condition seems to be vastly exacerbated by the hospital setting (sensory overload etc).

In hindsight, I probably should have communicated these issues to the clinical supervisor prior to undertaking placement, but I foolishly thought I could get by. I also was concerned about the overall impact of disclosing this information to them.

Since withdrawing things have improved alot. I'm working full-time in an unrelated area and overall wellbeing has improved. Whilst I still have mild anxiety, it is not at the crisis level it was during uni. However, the job is not a career and the shroud of having been so close to finishing my degree looms. 

I'm unsure if I can even finish my degree at this point, or if being a physio is the right career choice for me personally. Just wondering if anyone has any advice or suggestions should I choose to return? Thanks","Quit my physio degree in final year due to panic disorder, weighing up a return to study. Any Advice? (AUS)"
