Chiropractic,"I have recently had a leg surgery called mosaicplaste on my ankle and knee and have been and will be non weight bearing for close to 3 months. I have always had back pain same side as my surgery, laying or sitting for long periods of time are the worst for me so needless to say my sciatic pain has been awful and I can’t do my normal stretches to loosen up my back can’t bend knee do to staples .

Chiropractic,"I’m no chiropractor, but I know a lot of average cases are with people with some sort of back ache/pain or something to do with the shoulders, but I never real have heard anyone have symptoms I have if I don’t get some help besides a couple people.

As a bodybuilder, I’m probably just more always of my body and quality of life, but some days I just feel the worse and know it’s due to a vertebrae being misaligned, and when I go they are like yup, your atlas is very out, blah blah.  Sacrum and t3, basically wherever I feel the symptom. Sometimes I feel like I can’t breathe and get anxiety that I’ve never experienced before after getting pain in my upper thoracic, and these are the worst sleepless nights. And these all go away after getting adjusted, and I can live my life, most symptoms I’ve noticed for myself anyways go away after cervical alignment. 

One thing I’ve always wondered was this due to my genetics or result of an injury/adaptation? If I had the same injury as someone, since biomechanilly we’re the same, would I feel the same pain and symptoms, or is it just due to luck? I’m guessing it’s just compensation because that’s what your job is to literally adapt the spine back to what it’s supposed to be. Thinking back when people hurt their ribs or break a bone, they usually get some of the worst symptoms besides pains even though they are perfectly healthy like me",Are symptoms of nerve/spinal injuries/misalignments genetic or result of injury/compensation.
Chiropractic,"I wrote a similar post to this a few days ago, but it was removed because I was “asking for medical advice”, so let me try to out this another way. 

Was hoping somebody could give me some more insight into atlas orthogonal. I asked this in another sub, but hardly anybody knew this sub field.

Had three atlas orthogonal adjustments, but it made my neck pain worse. Ironic, considering I didn’t go to AO for pain in the first place but I did have some neck pain, but it was significantly lower than what I experience now.


The chiro took pre adjustment and post adjustment x-rays. Of course pre adjustment he showed me how straight my neck looked, but after one adjustment showed me how much more curved my neck looked. I’m no doctor, but I thought the bones were a lot stronger than we give them credit for..? I just can’t imagine my neck going from straight (I think he called it “military neck”) to curved in the span of one adjustment.",Anybody know much about atlas orthogonal?

Chiropractic,"If atlas misalignment is due to the dysfunction of the muscle around the atlas, why chiropractic can help? Doesn’t it mean after adjustment it will simply go back to misalignment?

Chiropractic,"Been seeing a chiro for some time now and seeing minimal results. One thing that he tested was my HRV. I sat down and put the tips of my fingers on some pad and sat there for a few minutes. It calculated my HRV and then he did an adjustment on me. I asked how the HRV device works and that from what I know you need weeks worth of constant HRV tracking to have enough data to come to conclusions. He said no and explained how this new device is able to track your HRV in less than 5 minutes.

After my first time, no change. No big deal, I thought maybe I should wait after my second time to see something. I get adjusted for a second time, and I notice that night )”how my neck HURTS. Not just sore, but actually hurts. I called the place the place the next morning frantic, and they assured me that pain was perfect normal. I waited two weeks and the pain got better but never fully subsided. Decided to give them one more try, but the pain never went away.

I called in again and voiced my frustration. I was firm but was never disrespectful. I said how I felt even worse off than when I began. We had a good 30 min convo and it basically ended with him completely back tracking and saying how “atlas orthogonal isn’t for everyone”/ “we aren’t miracle workers”. Again, just completely backtracking on all the claims he made during my consultation.


I did have a pre adjustment and post x rays, and he tried to say how much the curvature of my neck improved, with lines and random numbers. Thinking about it now, I don’t really know what I was looking at. I’m not saying they manipulated my post adjustment x rays, but I’m not saying the change in shape of my neck all came from ONE adjustment…

Chiropractic,"Don't quite know where to start, looking for some advice, I guess. Completely aware I'm going to sound dumb here, but anyways. I finished up my 4th trimester (out of 11) a couple of weeks ago. For about a year now I've been having second thoughts about studying Chiropractic. I don't really have anything negative to say about the profession, my issues with it are more personal. Some background info:

* I am terrified of the Income to Debt ratio, especially starting out. Living away from home and being a Canadian studying in the states, I'm probably looking at around $250K CAD in loans when this is all said and done. I fear the earning potential and what that means in a HCOL city like Toronto. I’m kind of a risk adverse person and the financial uncertainty brings me great anxiety. My intention would be to start a practice, but I worry I would have to provide service that I do not agree with to make a livable wage. I’m curious to hear from other Ontario Chiros regarding this.

* Feels like I'm here for the wrong reasons. I look at the love and passion my classmates have for Chiropractic and I just don't share it. My priority is to make a good living. I was stuck in a hard place and didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. This profession, with an application process that accepts anyone with a pulse, threw me a branch and I took it.

* I attend a small Evidence-Based School. The profs here honestly aren't great, it really doesn't help. They are knowledgeable but grossly unorganized. Teaching is probably their last priority and it shows. This is a common sentiment among my cohort. 

* I have a lot of regrets and spend a lot of time looking back. Its unhealthy. I am not happy that I'm a Chiropractic student, nor do I have an ounce of pride in the fact. Would I hate my life as a Chiro, probably not? I'm solid at the few adjustments we've learned, and school is kind of a cakewalk so I don't have a problem picking up the material. But I sometimes struggle to care about the material, and often tune out my peer’s conversations about Chiropractic.  

My dilemma is, I've been debating a switch to IT for a while. I have a love for computers and tech, they are my passion in life and working with them brings me genuine joy. I've learnt a lot in the past year and honestly think I'd be quite successful in that industry. Every field has its challenges, but it feels like there is more money and less stress in IT for a person like me. Sounds fine and dandy, but sunk cost fallacy. I'm 25 y/o and already 16 months deep into the program with 100k CAD of student loan debt. Why didn't I go into IT from the get go? I didn't know it was an option as a Biology graduate. Didn't learn until I was already a Chiro student. From people I've had this talk with, I've been told that there is indeed great money in Chiro and doing both at the same time may be a good way to go, but I don't see how. It would make Chiro one hell of an expensive safety blanket, and honestly seems nonsensical, you aren't going to be successful in either field if you don't give em 100% of your time and effort. 

Don't know, just venting at this point. I'm curious if any other students here have doubts, and what you've done to address them. Same for any practicing Chiros, did you have doubts, any lingering regrets? Did you suck it up and go through the program anyways? Would you do it all again in hindsight?","Current Student, Constantly Having Regrets and Second Thoughts"

Chiropractic,"## What causes poor posture?

Conditions which impair one or more of the body's supporting structures, such as the spine, back muscles, hips, shoulders, neck and abdominal wall, can also create posture issues.

People with hereditary disorders that impact the curvature of the spine and hips can correct posture from birth in some situations. Such problems can be addressed to reduce the negative impact on posture which they can have over time. In some situations, injuries sustained while participating in sports or other activities might change posture, as the body attempts to protect itself from further injuries (such as limping when your foot is injured).

Our posture often changes due to our work or other activities which cause misuse of various body parts. Underuse can be a concern as well. Weak back muscles on either side of the spine, or weak abdominal wall muscles in front of our bodies, for example, might make it difficult to maintain excellent posture.

Many people's muscles and ligaments tighten or weaken due to sitting for long periods of time. This can also result in bad posture.

## Tips for how to improve your posture

* Regular exercise, even a brisk 10-minute walk, can help improve your overall health and posture by keeping your body supple and active.
* Gentle workouts like yoga and Pilates can help strengthen and improve your posture by improving the support muscles in your back and stomach. Concentrate on strengthening your core muscles (torso and pelvis) daily.
* Simple stretching exercises should be done for 10 minutes each day.
* Stand tall by straightening your spine, lowering your shoulders to their natural resting position and inhaling deeply to contract your abdominal muscles.
* Simple head movements can help release tight neck muscles which can make it difficult to maintain excellent posture. Make little circles with your head, or move it from front to back and side to side.
* Allow your body to restore its normal resting position by lying flat on the ground on your back for two to three minutes once a day, without utilizing any cushions or support.
* To aid in even weight distribution, wear flat, well-fitting shoes.
* Lift objects with your hips, knees, and thighs rather than your back.

## What you can do at home

When seated, avoid crossing your legs since it can overstretch one side of your leg muscles and alter the alignment of your spine over time (especially if you cross your legs the same way, every time). Spend as little time as possible on low-sitting sofas or particularly soft chairs. When sleeping, try to utilize a single firm support pillow to avoid neck strain. Lying on your side with your knees bent is the best position; make sure you have a firm mattress as well.

Make sure the weight of any luggage or heavy objects is distributed evenly on both sides of your body. Weight can be distributed equally over your shoulders with a backpack. If you're a caregiver who spends a lot of time lifting, pushing or carrying the person you're caring for, make sure you're taking care of your posture.

How to improve your workplace posture

Keep your back straight, knees and hips level, and your feet flat on the ground while seated. To keep your hips and knees level, you might make use of a footrest. If you sit for long periods, you should use a small rolled towel or a commercial device to support your lower back against the back of your chair.

When using a laptop or desktop computer, avoid sitting in a slumped position for long periods. Make sure you get up and walk around frequently to keep your body in a looser position. Ask your company for training on how to lift and carry big or bulky, awkward goods, if your employment requires a lot of repetitive activities such as lifting and bending.

You may get phone strain if you spend a lot of time on the phone. A headset is more comfortable than laying your phone on your shoulder and twisting your neck to keep it in place.

## How to improve your driving posture

To ensure safe and comfortable driving, ensure your car seat and headrest are in the proper positions. Adjust the steering wheel so it’s level with your chest rather than your face. Bend your arms and place your thumbs on the steering wheel's rim. Set yourself deep in the seat, supporting your body with your left foot, and keep the seat reasonably upright to support your back and shoulders.

Chiropractic,"I hope this post is appropriate for the sub.

I bought a chirp wheel for my chronic upper back and neck pain. And while it helped in some regard, it started causing stiffness in the muscles surrounding my upper spine. It wasn't all the muscles, it seemed like inner muscles. I'd most notice an issue when I twist even for normal activities like sitting up, looking to the side, or pushing a button on a microwave (indirect twist via my arm), or reaching upwards. 

A couple times I pulled a very specific small strip of muscle next to my spine that caused a burning sensation every 10 seconds. I called it a ""hot fork"", felt like someone was scraping a sideways hot fork down my back. This burning lasted over a week and no stretching, resting, or painkillers would help it. I couldn't sleep and I was miserable. I thought this occurred due to something else, but it happened again without the external factor and determined it was from the wheel.

I let my mom (who also has upper back pain) use the wheels to see if I could give them to her. At first she loved it and it cracked her back. The second time she had the same issue with the spine stiffness. So I will be returning them.

We were both gentle with the rolling, no sudden movements during.

Chiropractic,"Straight to the point I'm a dumbass with OCD and I sometimes do overstretching. Lately I've been hung up on doing kind of a shrug while bent over neck neutral arms out to each side (usually natural, pronated or supinated) and I'll shrug pretty fucking hard over and over until I feel a crack or pop in the neck traps upper back shoulder area. (I get those feelings when doing other stretches sometime that has been deemed safe) but I'll be honest this is unfortunately s new ritual for me so I'm trying to avoid it. It does not help that my lef tshouldrr feels bad and pops sometimes but I'm pretty sure that's because of posture. I do weightlifting and I need to work on some stabilizer muscles and stretch my biceps tendon and shoulders. The stretches seem to be working for it but I want to go to the chiropractor anyway to address the shoulder which feels good 80 of the time and 20 it feels a little bad

The problem now is that I am certain when I do the chin tucks earlier this week (after a massive nice pop and shrug) had made no noise but now it makes those crackling noises because I tried to do the shrug thing again due to the ritual. 

Why does this happen?

I want to just do full stop now but if it's a chance to quiet my neck down while doing tucks then I don't want to 

I've had neck noise like that all my life so I'm pretty sure it's been normal for me none the less it's just weird that I had several days with no crackling anywhere except my shoulder after my shrug release thing but now it's all noise again.

Chiropractic,"Hi all, I'm not looking for free medical advice, I'm just hoping that someone can point me in the right direction of the right kind of medical professional to see. I've tried seeing soft tissue therapists and a chiropractor and so far no one has been able to successfully help me with my issue.
I'm 32 and about 2 years ago my neck started cracking / crunching when I turn my head to the left. It happens every time I do this movement so it isn't likely to be gas bubbles. I have not had a significant physical injury that could have brought it on, and given that I'm still quite young I doubt it is arthritis (?) . I get a lot of neck pain, although not specifically when I crack it, &amp; I believe it must be linked.
I have spent hundreds on the chiropractor, who seemed to help at first but after the first couple of sessions there wasn't any change.

Chiropractic,"Heya, so I went to my chiropractor originally because I fell on my roller skates right on my bottom/lower back.
This was in August maybe. I only started regularly going around October to November? I've had about 7 sessions with him. The last session was 5 weeks apart from the second last because I was experiencing less pain in my coccyx area.

Ever since I've gone to him my back has been cracking. Every day. When I change positions whilst lying down in bed.

I'm really worried because frequent cracking could lead to bone wear down as it says on Google.

Chiropractic,"Hi all,

Not looking for medical advice - looking to answer this question objectively so I can decide to either go back to my doctor, or, book to see a chiropractor if needed. 

For context:

I figured this would be the best place to ask this question. I asked my doctor a few weeks ago and he couldn’t see a link between the two actions.

I have a (terrible) habit of cracking my own neck, probably 5-10 times a day. I know that I need to stop this, but I’m really struggling to break the habit. The second part of this is that for the last 3 months or so I’ve had chest pain - I think the two might be related. The pain is centre right of my chest, and it gets worse if I stretch in certain positions. I would describe the pain as similar to pushing a bruise. Could my neck cracking be causing this?

I wanted to ask this community as I think you’ll have better knowledge and expertise in this area.

Appreciate any feedback. Thank you.",Does cracking your own neck (non-professionally) cause chest pain?

Chiropractic,"21 yo, male, healthy for the most part.

Around April I most likely herniated a disc which caused me to be flexion intolerant in the lumbar region. I am still dealing with low back pain but am confident that will be resolved. What I am quite worried about is my midback/ neck pain. I have tried *quite* a bit: foam rolling, mobility training, stretching, strengthening, dry needling, massage, electric stimulus (H-Wave), chiro, NSAIDS... and to no avail. 

In May I went to the chiro to help deal with my mid back/ low back and he did a manual adjustment which helped tremendously, I think. I was pain free for about a couple of weeks then it started to come back. At this time I was seeing the clinic regularly and they were going down each of the spinous processes with a gun and ""adjusting"" me with that apparatus. I saw no change in low back pain. I decided to leave that clinic since I was seeing little to no progress in the low back area when I was dealing with a ton of pain.

Later in the summer I went to go see a DPT and we did a ton of work that did nothing for any part of my body really. Bunch of dry needling.

Now I am seeing a chiro and he took three tests - [HRV](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-rate-variability-new-way-track-well-2017112212789), [thermal](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Advances-in-Paraspinal-Thermographic-Analysis-Wallace-Wallace/4d0b1b3dbf97dde1354a74deab91156f31562af5?p2df), [EMG](http://www.mccoypress.net/resources/cla/semg_review.pdf). Here were my [results](https://www.loom.com/share/c5d4d375c14140bdb9696b3b3b13fa9d) explained by the dr.

The tests show that I am making progress and I guess I am. My pain is less intense and not as frequent, but I still feel terrible... especially around the cervical/ thoracic area. I wanted your guys' advice on whether or not I should keep seeing the chiro for my adjustments or cancel my treatment plan and go else where. I paid $1,400 and I certainly don't feel like I got what I paid for at all. The treatment plan was three months and I am one month in. 

Currently I am doing the McGill method for fixing my low back. I am very confident my low back will resolve, but I am worried about my midback/ neck area. The pain I feel in the mid back is typically a throbbing sensation. I used to work as a waiter where I would constantly be picking up plates and trays and putting them down. At the end of my shift my mid back would just be warm and throbbing in pain. It was a localized area as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/ndGwRSp). The top image was when I got out of work and came home (2 months ago). The bottom image was just a few days ago where at night I was feeling a ""line"" from both spots. Standing for long periods of time will trigger my pain and recently if I compress my ribcage (think CPR) I will notice that line be triggered (bottom image).

I am just frustrated and wanted your opinions on how I can move forward. Should I keep seeing my chiro or look else where?

I was getting treatment for my shoulders and the practitioner also did my neck and lower back. The way he did lower back adjustment was by having me lay on my side and bring my one leg up to toward the face. Then, he would press my shoulder and knee so that my waist will twist. 

When my back did not crack, he said he wanted to have ""another go"" and put more body weight. My back still didn't go off. It was a bit painful but it wasn't anything serious then. After this day, though, it started to throb. Now it hurts to the point where I cannot bend over without having pain in my lower back. It's been a week since that bad treatment occurred.

anyway, I love getting adjustments (if you're in school to be a chiropractor and need a test dummy, I'm free and very willing) and yes doing my own adjustment. I used to be able to crack my neck and back EXTREMELY well (like youtube worthy crunch noises...) but a few years ago I broke my tailbone (ouch....) for the second time in my life. I had to sleep on my back for months (and I'm a side only sleeper) but it was way too painful any other way. I also couldn't flex/stretch/move my body in any kind of way to crack it (I'd do the twist to each side thing) so ever since then I've lost my ability to crack on my own as well (I'd say I'm at 10% where I once was) so that's weird right? (because if I go to a chiropractor with enough force they can get the job done!) my right side of my neck is so bad that when it's stretched in certain ways I feel an almost air pocket in my ear/jaw area that literally builds with pressure until I can get to the point of one measly crack.....  

but that's not the weirdest thing.... standing up for long periods of time isn't fun and I used to get HORRIBLE back pain that I clearly couldn't elevate on my own til on accident one day I was sitting on a step stool and the way I was sitting it was almost as if my tailbone was touching the curve where the top and side of the stool met and if I would lean back, my back literally feels like it drops back into place! it feels amazing but I must admit sometimes the noise (coming from a lover of the sound of bones cracking) is a bit startlingly how forceful it seems to go back down (sorry that's the only way I can describe it. I've been able to modify the adjustment technique to work sometimes sitting indian style on a hard tile floor and with my hips/tailbone area being the last contact point on the floor, sit perfect posture, hold onto my knees with my hands for an opposite force that allows the same thing to happen. what the hell is going on!",what's wrong with my bonez? :/

Chiropractic,"Hey there

Not sure if it’s the best place to post this but here goes. I’m a bit of a hypocondriac first off!!

I’ve had sciatica on off for many years - eventually going to see a chiropractor a few years back where the x ray showed my pelvis was out of alignment, due to one leg being slightly longer than the other. General wear and tear as well as a herniated disc! (I think l5-s1). So after a few cracks and I felt much better for a while. But over lockdown and a few bad deadlifts and squats the pain came back and so I returned to the same chiropractor this week.

Instant relief. The usual pressure I felt in my lower right side of my back is gone ever since. We did before and after tests of how high I could lift my leg in terms of glutes and hamstring strength and there was a big difference.

I’m assuming this changed the position of how my leg is sitting slightly (it’s what it feels like, again not in a bad way). Within 10 minutes of leaving the chiropractor my hamstring and calf started to cramp up. It felt like it was the first time I’d been using the muscles or something! By the time I got home my calf was in ribbons. The muscle has been so cramped and sore but getting better every day.

I’m assuming nerve supply to these muscles is enhanced and my leg is working better ! It feels like the pressure I used to feel in my lower back is now going through my calf and hamstring where it should be going!

The thing is - and what I noticed is my calf on this leg is so weak! It’s a real challenge to do a single leg standing calf raise here. I can just about do a few if I’m not fatigued and it’s very hard to get a deep connection at the end. Feels very weak. And I can only assume it’s been like this for a while and I never noticed. I can do double leg fine and I can get good muscle contractions there when I have my weight supported. fatigues easily though and like I said it’s still very sore. It’s like it’s been blitzed!

Now the panic side of me that has only suddenly noticed this is in a sudden panic I have motor neuron or something and it’s a first sign. The rational side of me thinks it’s oobviously connected to the herniated disc and the adjustment.

But is there anyone who could shed some light on what’s happened here specifically and why I don’t have motor neuron 😂

Thanks guys",Herniated disc and weak calf
Chiropractic,"I've had a constant headache problem since I was 14. I saw several different types of doctors and tried many things (mostly migraine treatments) and nothing ever helped. I saw a chiropractor many years ago for about a month which didn't provide relief. I don't think he took any xrays.

Despite the issue never going away, and gradually developing chronic back pain in the past few years, I never had a clue what was wrong with me until I randomly stumbled upon the concept of ""cervicogenic headache"" online. I arranged for a consult at a spine/physical therapy rehab place and they showed me I have scoliosis and straightening of the cervical lordosis.

Suddenly all of the weird indescribable pain/discomfort I've always felt makes total sense. Unlike every other condition I was persuaded to believe (and wanted to believe out of desperation for answers) was causing my problem, this actually makes things clear and gives me hope for the first time in a long time.

It seems like what I need is a care regimen at a rehab center with a combination of physical therapy, chiropractic care, acupuncture, technologies like pettibon, spinal decompression etc. The rehab clinic I am considering paying is suggesting a few sessions per week for a few weeks, then I should have a lot of relief that will last with some regular at home maintenance and periodic visits. Money is tight however and I am worrying about investing too much into the wrong care.  

I did some research and it seems like the consensus based on statistics is that chiropractic care is generally safe and can be beneficial even if it simply provides temporary relief. However some chiro's make bold claims such as being able to correct scoliosis and that is what you need to be careful of. One rehab center I had an evaluation at said the curve might change a little but most likely won't change. The chiropractor at the other, more affordable one claims with their ""posture correction process"" the curve will be corrected...

**TL,DR: Should I tell the chiropractor I want to avoid posture correction and focus on other things? Should I avoid paying for chiro and focus on P/T and acupuncture?

Chiropractic,"Let me explain.. so i have somewhat of an uncommon but not rare condition where i have an extra lumbar vertebrae (L6). My (Gonstead) chiropractor knows this as he is the one who pointed it out to me on my xrays. Lately he has been focusing on a problem area at T12 in my mid back, and has been doing the knee chest technique, which is basically where you get on your knees and put your face into the facerest while he pushes into your spine. He has done this about four times over the course of several weeks, and this have been somewhat painful in the lumbar spine area. Any pain or discomfort from the adjustment goes away almost immediatly when i stand up and never returns when i leave the office. However this morning, as im getting into position and waiting for the adjustment, he stops as if he just thought of something, takes a look at my xrays that are on the wall (i assume as i am facedown, but i hear him take a step in that direction) and then says something along the lines of ""Ahh yes, we count up from L6 to find t12."" My question is, did he completely forget that i have an extra vertebrae, miscounted, and was adjusting the wrong one this whole time? Im assuming if this is the case that he would have been adjusting L1 I believe? coincidentally this is the only time where the adjustment was not painful or felt in my lumbar spine. In fact it felt just like a normal but intense adjustment. Was there any danger to what he was doing before? and how do i bring this up to avoid it happening again in the future.

These are the numbers we got from our biller.  Plus we don't get paid for examinations or any other ancillary services by Medicare. Burn the system. Cash is king!

Chiropractic,"Hi! If this isn't the right place to post this, apologies.

I just came from my first visit to a chiropractor in a long time and she mentioned that my neck is in an S-curve. She repeatedly asked if I had been in a bad car accident (whiplash), thrown from a horse, etc. I honestly don't have any memory of anything like that.

I was wondering what other type of things could cause that? She really wants me to try to remember and now I'm like ugh did something happen to me and I blocked it or something. :-/

Any help would be appreciated!",Question about S-curve neck cause
